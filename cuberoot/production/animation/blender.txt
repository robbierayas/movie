● Editing Walking.fbx in Blender to Take Shorter Steps

  1. Import the FBX into Blender

  # Open Blender (3.x or 4.x recommended)
  File → Import → FBX (.fbx)
  # Navigate to: characters/alex/character.fbx (or Walking.fbx)

  Import Settings:
  - ✅ Automatic Bone Orientation (enabled)
  - ✅ Import Animation (enabled)
  - Scale: 1.0

  2. Locate the Animation Data

  Once imported:
  1. Select the Armature (skeleton) in the outliner
  2. Switch to Animation workspace (top tabs)
  3. Open Dope Sheet editor
  4. Change mode from "Dope Sheet" to "Action Editor"
  5. You'll see the walking animation keyframes

  3. Find the Root Motion Bone

  The stride length is controlled by the root bone's position:

  1. In the 3D Viewport, select the armature
  2. Enter Pose Mode (Ctrl+Tab or mode dropdown)
  3. Look for bones named:
    - Hips (most common in Mixamo)
    - Root
    - mixamorig:Hips

  4. Reduce Stride Length

  Method A: Scale Position Keyframes

  1. In Dope Sheet or Graph Editor:
    - Select the root bone (Hips)
    - Find the Location Z channel (forward/back movement)
    - You'll see keyframes showing the forward motion
  2. Select all Z-location keyframes:
    - In Graph Editor: Select the curve
    - Press S (scale), then Y (constrain to Y-axis/values)
    - Type 0.5 and press Enter

  This scales the stride to 50% of original length

  Method B: Manually Edit Keyframes

  In Graph Editor:
  1. Select root bone → Location Z curve
  2. If walking goes from Z=0 to Z=2.0 over the cycle:
    - Select the keyframe at max position (Z=2.0)
    - Press G (grab/move), Y (constrain)
    - Move down to Z=0.3 (or desired stride)
    - This makes the character step only 0.3m instead of 2.0m

  5. Important: Understand What You're Changing

  Your current distancePerCycle values:
  // In sceneConfig.js
  distancePerCycle: ANIMATION_SPEED.WALK_DISTANCE_PER_CYCLE  // Usually 2.0

  If you reduce the animation's stride from 2.0m to 0.3m:
  - Update your code to match:
  distancePerCycle: 0.3  // Match the edited animation

  6. Preview the Animation

  - Press Spacebar to play animation in Blender
  - Watch the character move in the viewport
  - Check that:
    - Feet don't slide on ground
    - Steps look natural (not too slow or fast)
    - Character still has weight shift

  7. Export Back to FBX

  File → Export → FBX (.fbx)

  Export Settings:
  - ✅ Selected Objects (select armature only)
  - ✅ Bake Animation (enabled)
  - ✅ NLA Strips or All Actions (depending on version)
  - Path Mode: Copy (bundles everything)
  - Apply Transform: FBX Units Scale
  - Forward: -Z Forward
  - Up: Y Up

  Save as: characters/alex/ShortStep.fbx (keep original as backup!)

  8. Use in Your Scene

  Update sceneConfig.js:
  {
      id: 'alex',
      scale: CHARACTER_SCALE,
      actions: [
          {
              type: 'walk',
              event: 'alexStepsForward',
              delay: 0,
              endPosition: { x: 0.2, y: CHARACTER_HEIGHT.WALKING, z: -5.3 },
              distancePerCycle: 0.3,  // Match edited animation
              animationFile: 'ShortStep.fbx'  // Use custom animation
          }
      ]
  }

  Note: You'd need to modify BaseCharacter.js to support loading custom animation files per action, or pre-load the ShortStep animation.

  Alternative: Scale in Blender vs Code

  Option 1: Edit animation stride in Blender
  - ✅ Visually accurate
  - ✅ Animation matches code values
  - ❌ Requires Blender skills
  - ❌ Separate file per stride length

  Option 2: Scale in code only
  - ✅ No Blender needed
  - ✅ One animation file
  - ❌ Feet will slide on ground (visual artifact)
  - ❌ Character appears to "moonwalk"

  Why feet slide: The animation shows legs moving a certain distance, but your code moves the character model less/more. The legs think they're stepping 2m, but the body only moves 0.3m → sliding feet.

  Quick Test (No Blender)

  If you just want to test the concept:

  // Use regular walk animation but move shorter distance
  {
      type: 'walk',
      endPosition: { x: currentX + 0.3, y: 0.1, z: currentZ },
      distancePerCycle: 0.3  // Much shorter than animation's 2.0
  }

  This will work functionally but will have foot sliding because the animation's stride is still 2.0m while the character moves only 0.3m. It's good for prototyping but not final visuals.
