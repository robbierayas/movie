**For all cube mechanics, dimensional terminology, navigation theory, and memory erasure details, see: writing/mechanics.txt**

Scene 0 - Opening Trap: [TBD] Cold open showing dimensional horror in n=0.333 space. Establishes visual style, tone, and immediate stakes. Demonstrates the lethal reality of dimensional traps before we meet the main characters.

Scene 1 - Food Team Introduction: Alex arrives at INZO headquarters for a normal workday. Walking through the corporate lobby, she passes a massive timeline wall showing company history - INZO founded 1977, 1000 facilities by 2005, n=3 cube prototype 2010. Several milestone dates are redacted/painted over, including "1M PRISONERS," "EXTRASPATIAL FACILITY ESTABLISHED," and "SINGULARITY FACILITY APPROVED." The only visible Food Science milestone is "SOF-TAK DEVELOPED," which Alex touches with pride as she passes. In the Food Science lab, Alex works with Morris (disheveled, comic relief) on sof-tak - a bread-meat hybrid food product using molecular compression technology. Comic sequence: Alex shrinks sof-tak to microscopic size, Morris sneezes toward it, they fear it's lost, but when Alex applies the grow drop, the tiny sof-tak rolls into it and explosively expands back to full size. Scene establishes normal workplace routine that will contrast with horror to come, and demonstrates the shrinking/growing technology that will be relevant later.

Scene 2 - Marcus and Edgar Pre-Meeting: Marcus (head of Quantum Logistics) waits outside Edgar's office, watching sanitized corporate video about "dimensional efficiency solutions" and "humane environments." Marcus laughs bitterly at what they're leaving out. Edgar (VP of Logistics) greets him warmly with corporate buzzwords. Inside Edgar's office, Marcus starts to explain the "singularity event" crisis, but Edgar interrupts - he meant update on the team transition, not the science. Edgar explicitly states he doesn't understand the quantum stuff and just wants to know about the dollarinos (money). Reveals Food Experimentation team is being reassigned to Quantum Logistics. Marcus tries to warn that the upcoming meeting will be technical, but Edgar insists on attending to ensure "profit maximization" - revealing the core conflict between scientific reality and corporate priorities. Edgar's obliviousness to the danger establishes him as corporate enforcer while Marcus carries the weight of knowing the real stakes.

Scene 3 - Team Meeting: Food Experimentation team (Alex, Morris, Darius, Sofia) exits their building and walks across exterior courtyard toward the Quantum Logistics building - establishing that it's a separate cube-like structure, more secure and modern than their workspace. They enter the QL building (different aesthetic - more high-tech and sterile) and navigate to the conference room. Inside, they find Quantum Logistics team already seated (Lea, Nina, Rashid, Chen, Yuki), plus Marcus standing and Edgar observing. Marcus facilitates introductions between the two teams. Alex and Lea make brief eye contact - old college friends. Edgar stands to announce that Food Experimentation "doesn't exist anymore" - sof-tak has hit maximum profitability, and the team is being dissolved and reassigned. The Food team sits in shocked silence. Marcus begins presenting on INZO's dimensional storage history: started with n=4 hypercubes for prisoner containment, which was a scientific breakthrough but not profitable. They learned creating MORE space costs more, but LESS space saves money, so n=0 (point-dimension) became the focus. When Darius asks about "caveats" and Nina asks about safety issues, Sofia backs Nina up asking "what do you mean safety?" - Food team supporting QL's questioning. Edgar cuts them off and calls for a break. Lea invites Alex to get coffee, and they exit together. Scene establishes: (1) Quantum Logistics is physically separate from Food Experimentation, (2) Food team has no choice in reassignment, (3) Corporate profit drives everything, (4) There are safety concerns being downplayed, (5) Alex and Lea have history, (6) Food team supports QL team's questions, empowering them to speak up.

Scene 4 - Meeting Lea: Walking to the coffee area, Alex and Lea catch up briefly - it's been four years since college graduation. Lea notes Alex stayed with the sof-tak project and made it work. When Alex asks when Lea transferred to Quantum Logistics, Lea's mood shifts - two years ago when Marcus took over the division. The light conversation transitions to serious: Lea emphasizes safety concerns and her fear of "losing more people." She reveals employees (not just prisoners) are trapped in the dimensional experiments, though "not intentionally." Lea explains they started with noble scientific goals - understanding dimensional physics, solving impossible problems - but when Marcus pushed for profit, everything changed. Lea gets emotional and tells Alex that Edgar is coming to ensure everything is "about profit now," and warns it could get worse. Brief moment of levity when discussing sof-tak's nutritional value. As they return to the conference room, Lea urgently tells Alex to transfer all her lab supplies from Food Experimentation to Quantum Logistics before someone else takes them. Subtext: Lea's emotional distress has personal layers - Josh (theoretical physicist) is one of the trapped people, and he and Lea had unspoken romantic feelings. She doesn't tell Alex about Josh yet; it's too raw. Scene establishes: (1) Alex and Lea's friendship and trust, (2) The experiments have trapped people, (3) Profit pressure from Edgar is making things more dangerous, (4) Lea is emotionally burdened by what's happening, (5) Lea has personal stakes we don't fully understand yet.

Scene 5 - Cube Trap Death: Barry (bearded dimensional physicist, instrumentation specialist) is conducting an experiment in the Quantum Logistics lab. He's holding a device for the dimensional process when something goes wrong. He's suddenly pulled through into the n=0.333 dimension - disorienting transition, strange dimensional geometry. Trapped and alone, Barry realizes he's stuck but he's still holding the device he was working with. Using his instrumentation expertise, he begins jerryrigging the device to send things back through. Montage of him working - testing, failing, trying again. Finally, he succeeds in sending something small back through - he's found a way to communicate, but he's still trapped. The scene ends focused on Barry's badge photo, which will transition to his family photo on his desk in Scene 6. Establishes: (1) Barry is resourceful and alive inside, (2) His device is how messages can come through, (3) He worked closely with Chen, (4) The horror of being trapped but surviving.

Scene 6 - Lab Introduction and First Test: The scene opens on Barry's family photo on his desk in the Quantum Logistics lab - connecting to the badge photo from Scene 5. Camera pulls back to reveal Barry's empty workspace with subtle signs of his absence (coffee mug, unfinished work). The combined team (non-managers only, including the 5 remaining QL members: Lea, Nina, Rashid, Chen, Yuki) files into the lab area for casual exploration and getting-to-know-you interactions. Light banter and comic relief as they examine equipment. Someone asks Chen to demonstrate the n=0 transmitter. Chen looks momentarily scared: "As long as it's not alive." They use a basketball-sized sof-tak for the demo. Chen sends it through with a cool visual effect as it disappears into n=0 space. Successful test, thumbs up. But as Chen shuts down the transmitter, part of the sof-tak skin comes back through with a message scratched into it: "WE'RE ALL DYING." Horror realization hits the team - Barry sent this using the device he jerryrigged. Scene establishes: (1) Lab environment and n=0 transmitter technology, (2) Team bonding before the horror, (3) People trapped in the root cube (Barry and Josh, though Josh isn't mentioned yet) are conscious, suffering, and desperate, (4) Chen's fear of sending something "alive" foreshadows the danger, (5) Barry worked closely with Chen on instrumentation.

Scene 7 - The n=0.333 Explanation: Alex and Lea return from their coffee break to find only Marcus and Edgar in a smaller, more secure briefing room - the rest of the team isn't present. Marcus explains this is "need-to-know" information. He presents on n=0.333 (one-third dimension, cube root) - theoretically and mathematically possible, something they thought they understood. They've successfully stored and retrieved objects of all sizes with perfect retrieval rate, but they cannot retrieve people. "They go in. We just... can't get them out." The physical limitations weren't realized until after human trials had already started. Marcus explains they need "fresh perspectives" and the company believes there's "synergy potential" between molecular compression and dimensional storage - why Food Science is being integrated. When Alex objects that she can't help and should decline the assignment, Edgar pleasantly threatens her: the company has a whole department for "competitive intelligence" that handles departures, references, and "social media management." Alex sits back down. When Alex asks if the trapped people are prisoners or employees, Marcus responds "Does it matter?" and Edgar casually reveals that if the n=0.333 project doesn't become profitable, "we all get sent to the cube anyway. Company policy. Failed projects get turned into test cases." Lea confirms he's not joking. The threat hangs in the air: they must make this work or become the research themselves. Scene establishes: (1) n=0.333 technical details, (2) People are trapped and can't be extracted, (3) Alex is being coerced to participate, (4) All of them are at risk if the project fails.

Scene 8 - The Lost Person Incident: Marcus and Edgar exit the secure briefing room. Edgar checks his tablet, oblivious to tension, says "Great session. Really getting that synergy flowing." They arrive at the lab where the rest of the team is examining equipment. Alex's old Food Experimentation supplies are being delivered. Morris holds up the sof-tak skin with "WE'RE ALL DYING" scratched into it, rambling about how concerning it is. Darius cuts in asking what the message means, Sofia asks who wrote it. Lea steps forward, asks everyone to sit. The team settles - Chen sits between Yuri and Rashid. Alex finishes signing for deliveries, receives the sof-tak skin, examines it silently - expression hardens. Marcus explains: three weeks ago Barry (dimensional physicist, instrumentation specialist) got sucked into n=0.333 during an experiment. Chen's jaw tightens - Barry was his close colleague. Darius immediately challenges "You kept going? After losing someone?" Lea's hands tighten in lap, voice strained: "We didn't shut down... we kept working." Marcus states they know Barry is safe, just trapped. Alex challenges directly: "You know he's safe? In the death cube?" Lea explains Barry jerryrigged his device to send things back - one-way communication only. Morris realizes Barry was "just right there" when Chen sent the sof-tak through earlier - Chen nods, pained. Yuki adds matter-of-fact technical comment: "'Just right there' might not mean the same in zero space-time, but yeah." Edgar calls this "acceptable risk" for data. Alex's eyes flash to Edgar then Marcus - Marcus meets her gaze but says nothing. Darius catches critical detail: message says "we're all dying" - plural. Marcus explains second incident: Josh (theoretical physicist) got sucked in two weeks ago. Lea's breath catches when Josh is mentioned. She explains with tight voice that Josh and Barry got separated somehow inside. Her hands shake - she grips them to steady herself. Marcus notes safety protocols implemented after Josh - too late. Alex deduces to Lea: "They were the experts. You wouldn't have let them work alone if you didn't trust them." Lea tries to speak about Josh but can't finish - voice cracks. Edgar cheerfully interjects about fresh perspectives. Sofia stares disbelieving, challenges him: "You're talking about people trapped in another dimension like it's a staffing issue." Edgar genuinely confused, defends his logic about bringing in best people. Alex cuts him off, redirects to Marcus: "What's the strange detail?" Marcus explains communications don't always seem from same person - handwriting and phrasing change. Lea says something's happening to consciousness/identity. Yuri comments about atoms, Rashid corrects "atoms collisions," Chen interrupts "we don't understand it fully." Yuri leans behind Chen to tap Rashid, whispers "that's if it's not subatomic." Nina has been silent, observing. She leans forward: "Lea, there's something else." Reveals new data from last 48 hours that Lea and Marcus haven't seen. Glances at Rashid and Yuki - they exchange knowing look. Nina: "The kind that changes everything." Team gathers around as Nina pulls up analysis. Alex still holds sof-tak skin with desperate message. Scene establishes: (1) Barry and Josh trapped and communicating, (2) Team kept experimenting despite losses, (3) Identity/consciousness changes in the root cube, (4) Lea's personal connection to Josh, (5) Edgar's obliviousness vs. team's moral awareness, (6) Alex emerging as challenger, (7) Chen's pain over Barry, (8) QL team (Nina, Rashid, Yuki) has critical data managers don't know about.

Scene 9 - Hypercube Singularity: Nina presents her analysis of the latest data. The cube is acting like a singularity, actively sucking in other cubes regardless of their dimensionality (n=0, n=3, n=4 - all being pulled in). Their experiments may have excited some quantum state, but this behavior is fundamental to the nature of fractional dimensions. The n=0.333 dimension can temporarily remain stable, but it needs to periodically add mass to maintain itself - like a hungry organism. Nina illustrates this with a fractal triangle diagram showing how the sides increase recursively. The room erupts into chaotic conversation - panic, questions, theories. Edgar asks for clarification: does this affect things outside the company? Nina confirms it's consuming everything, not contained. Edgar's obliviousness drops - he's visibly shaken as he realizes the mismanagement and how desperate the situation has become. Edgar cuts through chaos to direct the plan: they will treat the current trapped employees as "astronauts" who can only help by staying alive and providing data from inside. No rescue attempt yet. Instead, they'll prepare an expedition kit with food, measurement equipment, and communication devices to send in. Alex says they can actually help with the food supply issue and sends Morris and Darius to start shrinking food down. Marcus agrees with Edgar's plan. Lea and Alex push back on safety concerns - someone else could get sucked in during prep. Marcus, exasperated, says he doesn't have many options. Edgar offers to stand closest to the kit if it makes them feel better. Lea and Alex back off for now. They reach a compromise: late-night session to properly assemble the expedition kit with safety protocols. Importantly, NO ONE is going into the cube - just the equipment. As they break to begin preparations, Sofia asks Alex if she can run home quickly to deal with her kids before the late-night session. Scene establishes: (1) The root cube is a growing existential threat, not just company problem, (2) Edgar finally understands the real stakes and is shaken, (3) The trapped people are being treated as data sources, (4) Alex contributes practical solution (food shrinking), (5) Safety vs. urgency tension, Edgar willing to put himself at risk, (6) Sofia has family responsibilities.

Scene 10 - First Entry and Deaths: Late night. The expedition kit is ready - compressed sof-tak, measurement devices, communication equipment laid out. Team doing final checks. Alex adjusts sensors, Chen inspects relays, Lea checks compression ratios. Sofia did not return from Scene 9 (left to go home to kids). Edgar announces he's picking up dinner before final prep, exits saying "Don't start without me." Three conversations while he's gone: (1) Morris with Nina, Rashid, Yuki - scientific enthusiasm despite danger, rambling about measurements from fractional dimension "never been done. Ever," says it's "terrifying and people are trapped and we might die, but scientifically? This is... groundbreaking. In a very literal, dimension-breaking sense," they share genuine excitement about data possibilities; (2) Alex and Lea - quiet reflection on graduating ideals vs reality, Lea: "We were going to do good work. Important work. Help people" but it became "For profit. For prisons. For... this," Alex made sof-tak to solve hunger but "It's profitable. That's what matters to them," both say no when asked if this is what they wanted/deserved, Lea commits "We have to get them out. Barry. Josh," Alex promises "We will"; (3) Marcus pulls Darius aside privately, calls him smart and valuable, reveals INZO's brutal culture: "Low performers on failed projects don't get severance packages. They get test cases. They become research subjects. Probably death penalty, realistically," brings Darius into "inner circle," walks away leaving Darius processing. Edgar returns much earlier than expected - expression odd, tense, focused. Asks "Did you send the kit through yet?" When told no, responds "Good." Urgently: "I need everyone to come with me. Right now." Morris whispers to Nina wondering what happened. They follow Edgar through hallways to lobby. As they approach, Alex notices Sofia's purse on floor near lobby entrance - Sofia never returned. Edgar tells them "Look." Through windows: impossible geometry. Perfect cube walls where parking lot should be. Walls smooth, reflective, wrong. Rashid: "That's not..." Yuki: "That can't be..." Morris goes pale. Chen steps closer, transfixed and horrified. Exterior shot: QL building sits in center of enormous cube room, taking up roughly 1/8 of space - small, isolated, trapped. Walls shimmer with dimensional instability. This is the root cube. No parking lot. No courtyard. No Earth. Just void. Lea whispers "When did this..." Marcus: "The singularity. It pulled us in." Nina: "We didn't even feel it." Edgar doesn't know if it's just them or everything. Darius realizes: "We were preparing to send supplies in." Alex's eyes widen: "We're not sending an expedition." Edgar, grim: "We are the expedition." Morris looks sick. Nina grips table. Lea's breath comes short. Chen: "The kit. All that food..." Marcus: "It's ours now. What we prepared for Barry and Josh... it's all we have." Edgar explains he went for dinner, got to parking lot and this was already there. Voice cracks. Dark humor falls flat: "Hope you don't mind sof-tak for dinner." Lea to Alex: "Barry. Josh. They're somewhere in here." Alex promises "We'll find them" but voice lacks conviction. Marcus looks at fractal geometry, starts thinking navigation/survival. Edgar: "We're not ready for this." Alex turns from window, faces team with leadership: "No one's ever ready for this. But we're here. And we're alive. And we're smart. We figure it out." Supplies they prepared are now survival rations. Building is their prison. Root cube has claimed them. Josh and Barry somewhere in this space - Josh too scared to move, separated from Barry, lost. Sofia's location unknown - possibly found in Act 2. Fade out. End of Act 1. Scene establishes: (1) Three key conversations revealing character depths, (2) Marcus's brutal corporate reality, (3) Scientific enthusiasm vs ethical horror, (4) The shocking twist - they're trapped, (5) Alex emerging as leader, (6) Sofia missing (purse found, she never returned from leaving), (7) Edgar's realization and breakdown, (8) Cliffhanger to Act 2.

Second Third: Figuring Out to Get Out (~30-40 minutes)

Scene 11 - Survival and Rationing: Morning after being trapped. Edgar organizes rationing of expedition supplies. Debate: explore to find Josh/Barry/Sofia or stay and wait? Team votes to explore. Edgar transformed from oblivious corporate VP to committed leader. Team prepares and exits building together into root cube.

Scene 12 - Exit and Josh Arrives: Team exits building, transitions to normal size. QL building becomes dollhouse-sized behind them. Team redistributes supplies into backpacks. Josh suddenly enters from different door - changed by weeks in cube but alive. Lea's emotional reunion. Josh reveals Barry died ("stopped moving"), gives cryptic warnings about cube dangers ("exits lie," "keep moving," "no out, only through"). Team debates then decides to bring Josh along as guide. Josh leads them through next door.

Scene 13 - Into the Root Cube: Team follows Josh into n=3 cube rooms. Morris absentmindedly walks through door first without checking, causing sneeze scare. Marcus establishes authority over Morris as new manager, warns about life insurance and protocol. Door closes before Morris can follow group - cube mechanically rearranges, separating them. Team searches frantically until Morris reappears from ceiling door. Marcus shows vulnerability: "I'm not used to people dying." Darius questions Alex about blindly trusting Josh. Comic relief via Morris's "Yes Boss" and Nina's "Dr. Schroedinger" joke. Team establishes buddy system and commits to trusting Josh's navigation despite not understanding it.

**Equipment Note:**
The expedition kit includes communication equipment designed to transmit data OUT of the cube (not walkie talkies for inter-team communication). The team expected it wouldn't work inside the cube, and it doesn't.

Scene 14 - Successful Trap Room Navigation: Team encounters their first dangerous trap room. Working together with their combined expertise, they successfully navigate and solve it. Builds confidence and demonstrates teamwork. Establishes they can survive if they're careful and work together.

Scene 15 - First Cube Room Death (Rashid): Team enters deadly mathematical cube room trap. Rashid dies attempting to solve the trap's puzzle. Yuki survives but is traumatized by losing her fellow mathematician. Team escapes shaken. First death in Act 2, establishes stakes.

Scene 16 - Darius's Betrayal: Team resting after Rashid's death. Darius stands suddenly: "I'm done." Blames company leaders (Marcus, Edgar, Lea) for Rashid's death, doesn't trust them: "The company leaders. They'll let the rest of us die so they can survive and build more death traps." Tells Alex he trusts her but not the others. Believes escape is pointless: "We're never getting out. Josh said it - there is no out, only through." Wants to find somewhere to farm and survive. "Resigns" from INZO right there. Calls team "Bootlickers. All of you." Predicts "Next time I see you? You're dead. Because you followed them." NO ONE joins him despite his appeal to non-managers. Takes extra supplies, threatens Marcus with tool when he tries to stop him. To Alex: "I wish you'd come with me. But you won't leave them." Edgar organizes separate exits to avoid conflict. Darius leaves alone through different door. Only 2 rooms away from team. First major betrayal - but Darius is completely isolated, driven by distrust of corporate leadership.

Scene 17 - Sofia's Vacuum Death: Immediately after Scene 16 split, team enters dissolution room where floor slowly dissolves. They navigate it successfully and quickly. Edgar calls it "tame." Morris says "Maybe Darius was wrong about everything." Team has false confidence - think they're getting better at traps. Josh warns: "The cube lulls. Then strikes." Team exits dissolution room into next room. Sofia is already there by exit door, hand on button. Team yells "Sofia!" - she turns surprised, relieved: "Alex?!" Says "I think it's the exit!" Marcus commands "Open it!" Sofia presses button following his order. Josh shouts "DON'T—" but too late. Door opens to vacuum, not exit. Sofia's eyes widen in horror - realizes mistake. Violently sucked out into void, screaming cut off. Door automatically closes safely behind her (cube knows when to close - doesn't slice anyone). Team manages to avoid being pulled in. Marcus's command killed her - leader's decision directly causes death, validates Darius's accusations: "THEY will let you die." Yuki breaks down after witnessing this. Pulls away from Nina crying: "Darius was right." Louder, desperate: "DARIUS WAS RIGHT! He was RIGHT!" Turns toward walls screaming: "DARIUS! WHERE ARE YOU?! YOU WERE RIGHT!" Voice echoes through cube. Two rooms away, Darius hears faint screaming, recognizes voices, starts moving toward sound. Horrific death proves Darius's prediction right, Marcus's guilt compounding, team's hope crushed, sets up Scene 18 reunion with Darius.

Scene 18 - Floor Dissolution Fight: Main team (Alex, Marcus, Edgar, Josh, Lea, Morris, Nina, Yuki, Chen - 9 members) encounters Darius's group (Darius + 2 followers) in room with Floor Dissolution Trap. TEAM FRACTURES: Yuki steps forward - grief over Rashid and Sofia has shattered her faith in leadership, mathematical mind sees statistics (probability of survival following Marcus/Edgar approaching zero). Nina follows - idealism curdled to disillusionment, disappointed Lea sided with company leaders. Morris hesitates but fear wins over loyalty to Alex - haunted by Marcus's INZO revelation, terrified of being next to die. All three cross to Darius's side - united in fear and lost faith. Alex devastated but respects their choice, won't force them. Darius now has 6 people, demands more supplies. Edgar refuses: "We earned those supplies." DARIUS ATTACKS EDGAR: Steps forward aggressively, blames Edgar for everything as face of corporate leadership. Lunges at Edgar, grabs him by collar, slams him against wall - fury unleashed. Chen rushes to defend Edgar (practical instinct, loyal to leader). Violent grappling between Chen and Darius. They crash into wall - trap activates from impact. Chen fatally wounded - back hits dissolving wall section, screams as dissolve burns spread across back and side. Groups freeze in horror. Floor dissolution spreads - corrosive surface activating. Desperate escape: both groups navigate shrinking safe tiles. Marcus and Alex drag dying Chen across floor. Marcus steps on dissolving tile - boot corrodes, dissolve burn through to ankle (painful, will slow him). Darius touches activated wall edge - minor burn on hand. One of Darius's followers gets severe leg burns. Morris nearly dissolves, Yuki saves him. Groups reach separate exits - can't cross to each other, floor between them too dangerous. Last moment: Darius locks eyes with Alex, sees them dragging Chen's dissolving body, horror and guilt flash across his face. Both groups exit. Chen dies in next room - dissolve burns catastrophic, breathing stops, Alex closes his eyes. Only five left in main team: Alex, Marcus, Edgar, Josh, Lea. Darius's group now 6: Darius + 2 followers + Morris, Nina, Yuki. Team realizes: "Darius attacked Edgar. Not Marcus. Not me. Edgar specifically... Because I'm corporate. The VP." "Chen died because he was loyal. Because he defended Edgar." Josh: "The cube makes you fight each other. Easier to kill you that way. Loyalty. The cube punishes it too." Alex: "Cube is the enemy. Not them. No matter what Darius thinks." Establishes: Team fractures (Morris/Nina/Yuki defect), Darius targets Edgar as corporate symbol, Chen dies defending Edgar (loyalty punished), cube manipulates survivors into fighting, main team reduced to 5, Marcus injured (ankle burn will slow him), Darius feels guilt but still hostile.

Scene 19 - Edgar's Magnetic Pulse Death: Team of five (Alex, Marcus, Edgar, Josh, Lea) enters room with Magnetic Pulse Trap. Weak magnetic pulses start affecting Lea's earrings, Alex's watch. Josh warns: "Metal. Too much metal." Pulses get stronger. Edgar staggers - reveals he has replacement metal hips (not mentioned until this moment). Horror on team's faces. Massive pulse activates. Edgar lifted off floor toward ceiling by magnetic force pulling his metal hips. Slams into ceiling screaming. Falls partway, another pulse slams him into wall. Marcus tries to grab him but pushed back by field. Alex screaming Edgar's name. Lea tries to calculate escape but magnetic field too strong. Josh: "The trap is the room. Can't stop it." Edgar pulled ceiling to floor to wall - brutal, violent, unstoppable. Body destroyed by magnetic forces. Finally stops. Field drops, body falls dead. Marcus closes his eyes. Team grieves. Lea notices magnetic field lines visible in air extending into distance - can see barely visible cubes, dozens, hundreds stretching away. Josh: "You thought this was only one. The root cube is infinite. Cubes within cubes within cubes." Marcus: "How many are trapped here?" Josh: "All of them. Everyone INZO sent. Everyone the cube pulled in. Past, present, future. All here." Overwhelming scope - thousands potentially trapped. Lea: "We can't save them all." Alex: "We save ourselves first. Then we try." Must leave Edgar's body. Alex: "He would want us to keep moving." Marcus limping on ankle: "He stepped up when it mattered." Lea: "From corporate fool to leader. He earned that." Team reduced to four: Alex, Marcus, Josh, Lea. Edgar's heroic arc cut short. Marcus slowed by ankle injury from Scene 18.

Scene 20 - The Split: Only four survivors (Alex, Marcus, Josh, Lea) exhausted after Edgar's death. Marcus limping from ankle injury. Alex: "We keep moving. Find others. Learn about this place." Marcus: "For what? To watch them die too? Rashid, Sofia, Chen, Edgar..." Tension building. Marcus stands despite pain: "We have communication equipment. Measurement tools. We can BUILD something. Use the tech. Create a signal. Force a way out. Stop wandering and start engineering our escape." Frustrated: "I'm tired of watching people die while we explore." Technical, pragmatic, immediate approach. Alex counters: "And broadcast to who? We don't understand this place. We need information. We need to find others like Josh. Learn from survivors. Rushing in with tech is what INZO did. Look where that got us. Edgar died because we didn't know. Knowledge saves lives." Exploratory, patient, communicative. Philosophical debate intensifies. Marcus: "Every hour we wander, we lose supplies. Lose people. We're down to FOUR." Alex: "There is no escape without knowledge. Josh survived by learning the cube." Josh: "Both paths lead somewhere. Neither guaranteed. I survived. Barry didn't. The cube doesn't care which method you choose." Both look to Lea for tie-breaker. Marcus: "Lea, you're the physicist. Technical solution makes sense." Alex: "Lea, you want to find Josh. You did. We kept moving. We need to explore." Lea torn: "I... I see both sides. I can't. You're both right. You're both wrong. Josh survived by moving. But you're talking about building something. I won't split you up by choosing. I can't lose anyone else. Figure it out together." Marcus: "There is no together anymore. I'm taking equipment and building an exit." Decides to work ALONE. Alex: "Marcus, you're injured. You can't—" Marcus: "I've made my decision." Divides equipment - Marcus takes technical gear, communication devices, engineering tools. Alex/Lea/Josh keep supplies, measurement tools, navigation aids, sof-tak food. Josh: "I go where the movement goes. Alex keeps moving. I'll guide them." Walks to Alex. Lea helps Marcus pack despite going with Alex. Marcus refuses medical supplies. Lea: "Don't die out there alone." Marcus: "I've been carrying death since Sofia. Alone is better." Josh warns: "The cube likes division. Feeds on it." Marcus: "I'm always careful. It's everyone else who dies." Guilt and pragmatism. Marcus: "Eleven people entered this cube. Now four are left, and we're splitting." Alex: "Rashid, Sofia, Chen, Edgar... they're why we need to learn. Prevent more deaths." Marcus: "They're why I need to build. Get out before there's no one left." Lea: "Edgar united us when we were trapped. Wish he was here to keep us together." About Edgar: "He would. But he's dead. And I'm tired of losing people." MARCUS LEAVES ALONE - limping, guilt over Sofia driving isolation, heads to stable structure area to fortify and build technical solution. ALEX'S GROUP (3): Alex, Lea, Josh continue exploring deeper. Josh guiding, Lea providing dimensional expertise, Alex leading. Patient, exploratory, together. Team shattered: started 11, down to 4, now split into Marcus alone (1) and Alex's group (3). Darius's group still out there (6 people). Three separate groups, three different philosophies. Ideological split, not betrayal. Both approaches valid. Act 2 ends with divided survivors.
Last Third: Executing the Final Plan (~30-40 minutes)
Re-entry Shock: Escaping back to n=3 Earth reveals it too was sucked into the root cube, warping reality.
Final Plan & Scene (TBD): Open-ended for dramatic flexibility.
Possibilities: Confront Marcus's true motives; hypercube singularity implications; dimensional "containment" attempt; sacrifice for stabilization.
Themes: Cost of experimentation; dimensional instability; corporate ethics.

Time Estimate
Total runtime ~90-120 minutes, split:
First Third (~30-40 minutes): Setup n=0.333..., INZO, characters.
Second Third (~30-40 minutes): Trapped in n=3 cube, escape tension.
Last Third (~30-40 minutes): n=3 Earth affected; final plan unfolds.

Elements Fulfilled
Fan Service: Crazy traps, gory deaths, hateable bad guy (Marcus).
Company & Plot: INZO's prison motives, R&D focus, n=0.333... mystery.
Structure: Three acts match request.

## THEMATIC NOTE: TEAM EMPOWERMENT DYNAMIC

The Quantum Logistics team has been working under Marcus's management where speaking up gets shut down at the leadership level. When they interact with the Food Experimentation team and witness them questioning power without fear or giving up (Sofia backing Nina's safety question in Scene 3, Alex directly challenging Edgar and Marcus throughout Act 1, Darius catching details and demanding answers), the QL team gains confidence to act on their own convictions.

This dynamic builds throughout:
- Act 1: QL team sees FE team challenge authority fearlessly (Scene 3, 6, 8)
- Act 2, Scene 8: Nina and Yuki defect to Darius citing disillusionment with Lea siding with company leaders - QL team members choosing their own path rather than accepting leadership decisions
- Act 3: Nina and Yuki build memory shield devices and keep them secret from Marcus - ultimate expression of independence from authority

The FE team's fearless questioning of power gives the QL team permission to trust their own judgment and take action, leading directly to the ending where Nina and Yuki's independent work may save everyone.

## ROBBIE TODO LIST

- [ ] Darius should show more concern about Sofia in Act 2 Scenes 1-3 (they were close colleagues)
- [ ] Act 3 Scene 22: Add more for Marcus - guilt over deaths turning into resentment for being put in charge. very repetitive
- [ ] Act 3 Scene 23: Josh and Lea explanation 10 min long
- [ ] Act 3 Scene 25: " you need them. You can't get out alone"
