========================================

CUBE (1997)
-----------

1. Razor Wire Trap
   - 16 razor wires emerge from the ceiling
   - Wires rotate around the victim
   - Cuts victim's head, arms, and torso into 16 pieces
   - Kills: Alderson (opening scene)

2. Slice and Dice Trap
   - Razor-sharp grille unfolds from ceiling
   - Moves at very high speed
   - Cuts victim into small cubes

3. Acid Trap
   - Sprays acid directly at victim's face
   - Melts face away
   - Death from acid spray
   - Kills: Rennes (when testing room with boot)

4. Spike Trap / Spiked Poles Trap
   - Spikes emerge from walls or ceiling
   - Impales victims


CUBE 2: HYPERCUBE (2002)
------------------------

1. Gravity Manipulation
   - Rooms with reversed or altered gravity
   - Gravity can operate in different directions
   - Kills through disorientation and physical forces

2. Time Distortion Rooms
   - Zero-gravity and time-dilated environments
   - Causes rapid aging
   - Kills: Max and Julia (aged to death)

3. Tesseract/Hypercube Expansion
   - The structure itself can grow rapidly
   - Victims are shredded by expanding geometry
   - Kills: Jerry (shredded by expanding tesseract)

4. Reality Manipulation
   - Creates illusions
   - Controls time, space, and reality
   - Multiple versions of same person appear


CUBE ZERO (2004) - PREQUEL
---------------------------

1. Flamethrower Trap
   - Activates immediately upon entry
   - Flamethrowers emerge from all four walls (front, rear, left, right)

GENERAL TRAP CHARACTERISTICS:
------------------------------
- Rooms often tested by throwing boots inside first
- Traps activate when victim enters room
- Original film used prime number theory (later powers of primes) to identify trapped rooms
- Hypercube used more quantum/mathematical dangers vs mechanical traps
- Traps designed to kill quickly and efficiently
