SCENE 2 - MARCUS'S COMMUNICATION ATTEMPT
=========================================

LOCATION: Marcus's location in root cube (alone)

CHARACTERS:
- Marcus (working alone after Act 2 split)

SCENE LAYOUT:

1. MARCUS ALONE
   - Marcus in isolated location with equipment
   - Surrounded by technical gear and devices
   - Working methodically but showing signs of strain
   - Limping from ankle injury (Act 2 Scene 8)
   - Guilt weighing on him of subordinate deaths at his command, but transforming into resentment
      - RESENTMENT THEMES: Never asked to be Director, was promoted beyond his comfort zone, blames INZO for putting him
   in charge when he was just a scientist
   - Anger at Edgar for being VP but not taking command
   - Bitter about being "convenient" for INZO's needs
   - Rationalizes they are better without him. He'll only get them killed
   - Marcus: "Barry did it with parts so can I. He could have sent us a schematic though"
      - Marcus: "Never asked to be Director. Never asked to lead anyone. Edgar said 'Marcus can handle Quantum Logistics'
   like it was just paperwork."
      - Marcus: "They don't need me second-guessing every decision until someone else dies. Better I work the technical
   problem. That's what I'm good at. Not— not watching people—"
      - Marcus: "Alone is safer. Can't give fatal orders if there's no one to— Just me and the equipment and the math.
   That I can control."
      - Marcus: "Get this working, get back to the company, explain what happened. They'll understand. They have to
   understand I was trying to save everyone, I just— the calls I made were for them."
      - Marcus: "They put me in charge. I was doing research, actual science, and they promoted me to Director and
   suddenly I'm making life and death calls when all I wanted was to run experiments."

2. THE MINI-CUBE REVEALED
   - Marcus has kept mini-cube from Edgar's death room
   - Plans to take it back to avoid trouble with the company
   - Marcus: "Maybe you can— I need to take you back. Evidence. Proof we tried everything we could."
      - Marcus: "The company's going to want answers and I don't have good ones but if I bring back this, show them we
   can go beyond 0-space—"
      - Marcus: "Edgar stepped up when it mattered. He understood the stakes. And I— I tried - but somehow I get all the
   failure—"
      - Marcus: "He was VP. He could have taken command. Could have made the calls. But no, Marcus is Director of Quantum
   Logistics, so Marcus gets to watch people die following his orders. Edgar got to be the hero at the end, and I got to
   be the one who—"
   - Marcus: "Work for me as a bargaining chip with the company. Please. I need something to work. Just one thing."

3. COMMUNICATION ATTEMPTS
   - Attempting to establish contact, only static out of the speakers and on the screen
   - Jerryrigged equipment, similar to Barry's device but does not look completed
   - Repeated attempts to transmit signal
   - Adjusting dials, but talking about personal relationships and feelings
   - Guilt transforming into resentment as he talks
      - Marcus: "I thought if I just said what INZO wanted me to say, we'd all get out. But I'm not used to— I keep
   seeing Sofia's face when I said 'Open it!' and the vacuum just— I told myself I was protecting them by leaving. Can't
   experiment when that can kill people. But can't kill anyone if you're alone, right? But maybe I just couldn't face
   watching it happen again."
      - Marcus: "I shouldn't have been the one making that call. I'm a scientist. I analyze data, I run tests, I— I don't
   command people to open doors that might kill them. That's not what I signed up for when I took this job. But INZO
   needed a Director and I was— I was convenient."
      - Marcus: "Chen defended Edgar and I watched him get shoved into that wall and the screaming— I grabbed him, I
   tried, but his skin was— And I still had to keep moving because stopping meant we'd all—"
      - Marcus: "Rashid solved the puzzle while he was dying. Saved me. And I couldn't even— I just watched him bleed out
   and said 'thank you' like that was enough. Like any of my decisions were worth—"
      - Marcus: "They're better off without me making decisions. Every time I try to lead, someone dies. Maybe Alex was
   right. Maybe I was never supposed to be the one calling the shots."
   - Static and interference only response

5. UNSUCCESSFUL OUTCOMES
   - No successful contact made
   - Equipment limitations clear
   - Marcus's hubris confronted
   - Resentment peaks as failure becomes clear
   - He leans back to take relaxing swig from water bottle but it is empty
      - Marcus: "Nothing. Of course it's nothing. Barry work on this for yes and I thought I could be Director of QUANTUM
   LOGISTICS — Who was I kidding?"
      - Marcus: "Director. Like that means I should know how to lead people through impossible death traps. Like a title
   makes me qualified to— They gave me the job because I was good at the science. Not because I could handle watching
   people trust me and then—"
   - Marcus: "I'm alone because I chose it. Because I was so sure I could—"
      - Marcus: "No. I'm alone because they made me responsible for things I was never trained for. Never wanted. And
   when it all went wrong, when people started dying, suddenly it's all on Marcus. Director Marcus who couldn't keep his
   team alive."
      - Marcus: "Should have stayed together. Should have let Alex lead. And I could get work done without them holding
   me back. Oh Sofia, Rashid."
      - Marcus: "INZO did this. Not me. They built this cube. They sent us here. They promoted me to Director and then
   acted surprised when I couldn't— when I didn't—"
      - Marcus: "If my signal can get through, we can get out. I'm ready to go home; let me out. Please, I just need to
   get through—"
      - Marcus: "I need to tell them this wasn't my fault. I didn't ask for any of this. They put me in charge and people
   died and now— now I'm—"

TONE: Isolation and loneliness, mounting desperation, echoes of Edgar's sacrifice
CHARACTER DYNAMICS: Marcus struggling alone, pride versus failure

================================================================================

Description:
Marcus works alone with jerryrigged equipment, attempting to establish communication. He's kept the mini-cube from
Edgar's death room as evidence for the company. As his attempts fail with only static, he talks through his guilt over
Sofia, Chen, and Rashid's deaths, rationalizing his isolation while realizing he made the wrong choice. His desperate
attempts to contact anyone end in complete failure and loneliness.

Key Elements:
- Marcus alone with his equipment
- Reveals he kept mini-cube from Edgar's death room
- Attempting to make contact through static
- Communication attempts failing repeatedly
- Growing frustration and desperation
- Technical isolation and failure

Character Focus:
- Marcus: Isolated, desperate, failing
- Shows his technical approach isn't working
- Hubris in thinking he could solve it alone
- Physical reminder of Edgar's death (the mini-cube)

Technical Elements:
- Mini-cube device from Edgar's death
- Static/interference signals
- Attempted communication protocol
- Jerryrigged equipment similar to Barry's device
- Unsuccessful transmission attempts

Emotional Tone:
- Isolation and loneliness
- Frustration with failure
- Desperation mounting
- Echoes of Edgar's sacrifice
- Marcus's pride preventing him from seeking help

Notes:
This scene shows Marcus struggling alone and establishes the mini-cube as an important object that will appear again in
Scene 5. His failure here contrasts with the collaborative approaches of the other groups.

FULL SCRIPT:

FADE IN:

INT. ROOT CUBE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Marcus alone, surrounded by equipment spread out around him. He's limping as he moves between devices.
Jerryrigged setup that looks incomplete - wires, components scattered. Similar to Barry's device but clearly not
finished.

He adjusts a dial. Static crackles from a speaker. He grimaces and adjusts again. More static.

He sits heavily, favoring his injured ankle. Looks around the empty room.

Marcus turns to himself.

                    MARCUS
          Barry did it with parts. So can I.
          (beat, bitter)
          He could have sent us a schematic though.

He reaches for equipment, then pauses. Looks at his hands.

                    MARCUS (CONT'D)
          They don't need me second-guessing every decision until someone else dies. Better I work the
          technical problem. That's
          what I'm good at.
          (quieter)
          Not— not watching people—
          (voice hardening)
          Never asked to be Director. Never asked to lead anyone. I didn't want to be responsible for—

He doesn't finish. Returns to adjusting equipment, movements sharp and angry.

                    MARCUS (CONT'D)
          Alone is safer. Can't give fatal orders if there's no one to—
          (stops himself)
          Just me and the equipment and the math. That I can control.

A machine sparks. He sighs. He pulls something from his pack - the MINI-CUBE from Edgar's death room. Small, dense,
impossible. He holds it carefully.

                    MARCUS (CONT'D)
          Get this working, get back to the company, explain what happened.
          (looks at mini-cube)
          Maybe you can— I need to take you back. Evidence. Proof we tried everything we could.

He sets the mini-cube down gently near the equipment.

                    MARCUS (CONT'D)
          The company's going to want answers and I don't have good ones but if I bring back this, they'll understand.
          They have to understand.

He stares at it. He stops. Picks up the mini-cube again, turning it over.

                    MARCUS (CONT'D)
          Edgar stepped up when it mattered. He understood the stakes.
          (voice tight, bitter)
          And I— I tried— but somehow I get all the failure—
          (anger creeping in)
          He was VP. He could have taken command. Could have made the calls. But no, Marcus is Director of
          Quantum Logistics, so
          Marcus gets to watch people die following his orders. Edgar got to be the hero at the end, and I got
          to be the one who—

He sets it down. Returns to equipment. Flips a switch. Screen flickers with static. He leans forward, adjusts dials.

                    MARCUS (CONT'D)
          Work for me as a bargaining chip with the company. Please. I need something to work. Just one thing.

Static continues. He keeps adjusting, but starts talking more than working. He grips the dial tighter.

                    MARCUS (CONT'D)
          I told myself I was protecting them by leaving. Can't experiment when that can kill people. But can't
          kill anyone if
          you're alone, right?
          (bitter laugh)
          I'm a scientist. I analyze data, I run tests, I— I
          don't command people
          to open doors that might kill them. That's not what I signed up for when I took this job. But INZO
          needed a Director and
          I was— I was convenient.

He breaks off. He's barely looking at the equipment now, just moving his hands mechanically.

                    MARCUS (CONT'D)
          Rashid solved the puzzle while I was dying. Saved me. And I couldn't even— I just watched him bleed
          out and said 'thank
          you' like that was enough.
          (quieter)
          Like any of my decisions were worth—

He sits back. Reaches for his water bottle without looking. Tips it to his lips - empty. He stares at it for a moment,
then sets it down slowly.

                    MARCUS (CONT'D)
          Nothing. Of course it's nothing. Barry worked on this for years
          (bitter)
          Who am I kidding?
          (voice hardening with resentment)
          Director. Like that means I should know how to lead people through impossible death traps.

He looks around the empty room. The equipment humming uselessly. The mini-cube sitting silent.

                    MARCUS (CONT'D)
          I'm alone because I chose it. Because I was so sure I could—
          (stops, voice bitter)
          Now I need to just do it.

He stops. Looks at the doorway. At the path he didn't take.

                    MARCUS (CONT'D)
          Should have stayed together.
          (voice breaking)
          Oh Sofia. Rashid.
          (beat, then anger rising)
          INZO did this. Not me.

He turns back to the equipment one more time. Adjusts a final dial with sharp, angry movements.

                    MARCUS (CONT'D)
          If my signal can get through, we can get out. I'm ready to go home.
          (desperate, then bitter)
          Let me out. Please, I just need to get through—

Static. Just static.

Marcus stares at the screen.

Completely alone.

FADE OUT.
