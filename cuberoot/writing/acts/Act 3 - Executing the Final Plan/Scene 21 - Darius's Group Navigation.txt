SCENE LAYOUT:

1. TESTING METHOD - DARIUS'S DIFFERENCE
   - Group moving cautiously through rooms
   - Taking turns testing: Nina throws shoe, Yuki throws shoe, Morris throws shoe
   - When it's Darius's turn: he throws WRENCH instead of shoe
   - Everyone else uses shoes, only Darius uses wrench
   - More aggressive testing choice shows his different mindset
   - Moving back toward lab building location
   - 4 rooms shown on screen this scene

2. MORRIS'S PROTECTION FIELD IDEA
   - Morris proposes thought experiment about protective barrier
   - "What if we could replicate the lab building's field? An electron cloud shield?"
   - Inspired by how the building maintains stability in n=0.333

   - Theoretical problem-solving while moving
   - Morris trying to contribute meaningfully

3. DARIUS'S IRRITATION
   - Darius grows increasingly annoyed with the conversation
   - Dismissive of theoretical discussion
   - "We need to GET BACK first before any solution matters"
   - Tension building between Darius and Morris
   - Darius's impatience showing
   - Group cohesion straining

4. MEMORY SOLUTION FORMING
   - Nina and Yuki excitedly discuss electron shielding concept
   - Could protect memories during n=3 transition
   - Morris contributes uncertainly but helpfully
   - Solution starting to take shape
   - Darius throws wrench harder, frustrated
   - Scene ends with team continuing (3 more rooms happen offscreen before Scene 24)

TONE: Cautious navigation with underlying tension, Darius's growing frustration
CHARACTER DYNAMICS: Morris trying to help, Darius growing dismissive, Nina and Yuki engaged in science

================================================================================

Description:
Darius's group (Darius, Morris, Nina, Yuki) navigates through six rooms, testing each threshold before crossing. Nina,
Yuki, and Morris throw shoes to test rooms while Darius throws a wrench - showing his aggressive, different approach.
Morris proposes a thought experiment about replicating the lab building's protective field as a "mind shield" to protect
memories. Nina initially corrects him that it would only slow memory dampening, but Yuki realizes an electron barrier
could fully shield neural patterns during the transition back to three-space. The scientists excitedly discuss the
solution - with pauses where Rashid would have contributed, showing his absence. Morris tries to contribute but is
uncertain. Darius grows increasingly irritated, snapping "Great. A solution that only works if we GET BACK to the lab
building first." He dismisses the theoretical discussion as a distraction from immediate survival. When Morris tries to
explain the scientific thinking is relevant, Darius cuts him off: "It's relevant when we have somewhere to apply it.
Right now? It's a distraction." Nina stands up to Darius: "We can do both, Darius." Nina later tries to include Darius by
explaining root-space as a natural harmonic, but he only feigns interest. The group continues with visible fracturing -
Darius walks alone ahead with his wrench while Morris, Nina, and Yuki trail behind in quieter conversation.

Key Elements:
- Group moving cautiously through 4 rooms (shown on screen)
- Turn-taking for room testing: Nina/Yuki/Morris throw shoes, Darius throws wrench
- Only Darius uses wrench - everyone else uses shoes
- Morris proposes electron cloud shield concept - protective barrier like lab building's field
- Nina and Yuki immediately see this could solve memory erasure during n=3 return
- Discussion of electron shielding to protect memory vibrations
- Darius grows increasingly irritated: "We need to GET BACK first"
- Tension building between Darius and Morris
- Scene ends with 3 more rooms to go offscreen (total 7 before Scene 24)

Character Dynamics:
- Darius: Growing impatient and dismissive
- Morris: Trying to be helpful with scientific thinking
- Nina: Engaged in scientific discussion
- Yuki: Participating in theory discussion

Survival Strategy:
- Turn-taking for room testing: shoes for Nina/Yuki/Morris, wrench for Darius
- Darius's choice of wrench shows different/aggressive mindset
- Taking turns entering rooms for safety
- Attempting to navigate back to lab building
- 4 rooms shown this scene, 3 more offscreen before Scene 24, then 3 more in Scene 24 (10 total)
- Group cohesion straining

Notes:
This scene establishes Darius's growing frustration with Morris and sets up the eventual betrayal in Scene 4. The group
is still working together but tensions are rising.

FULL SCRIPT:

FADE IN:

INT. ROOT CUBE - DIMENSIONAL SPACE - CONTINUOUS

A featureless gray room. Four figures stand at the threshold: DARIUS (late 30s, precise and focused),
 Morris (40s, disheveled but earnest), NINA (youngest, analytical), and YUKI (quiet, observant).

Darius turns to Nina.

                    DARIUS
          Your turn.

Nina nods, removes her left shoe. She weighs it in her hand, then throws it across the threshold into the next room.

The shoe tumbles through the air, lands with a THUD on gray floor. Nothing happens.

They wait. Five seconds. Ten seconds.

                    MORRIS
          Well, technically speaking, that's... I mean, that's probably a good sign? The lack of immediate catastrophic
          response suggests—

                    DARIUS
          It's safe. Let's move.

Darius steps through first, followed by Nina. Morris and Yuki exchange a glance before following.

INT. ROOT CUBE - ROOM TWO - CONTINUOUS

The new room looks identical to the last. Nina retrieves her shoe.

                    YUKI
          Four rooms down. Six more to go.

Darius, checking makeshift map.

                    DARIUS
          If we don't hit another backtrack.

The group moves to the next threshold. Yuki removes her shoe, preparing to throw.

                    MORRIS
          You know, I've been thinking about something. The lab building—the way it stays stable in root-space...

Nina, immediately interested.

                    NINA
          The field generator...

Yuki throws her shoe. It lands safely.

                    MORRIS (CONT'D)
          What if we could replicate that on... on our minds? Like... A protective barrier?

Yuki, amused.

                    YUKI
          A mind shield!

                    MORRIS
          Exactly! I mean, probably. The way it creates a stable bubble—if we could apply that same principle to...
          well... our memories?

They move through the doorway.

INT. ROOT CUBE - ROOM THREE - CONTINUOUS

Yuki retrieves her shoe. Nina's eyes widen.

                    NINA
          Morris, that wouldn't fully solve the memory problem. The vibrational energy would not disperse outward, but
          it'd still need to be absorbed.

Yuki, fast-talking.

                    YUKI
          When we return to three-space, the vibration energy doesn't have time to transfer. But if we shield the waves
          with an electron barrier—

Nina, equally fast.

                    NINA
          —the memory information will continue propagating!

A pause where Rashid would previously finish their shared idea.

                    MORRIS(offering)
          And if we measure it before it fully damps, the information can be saved!

                    YUKI
          That's exactly right. If we could scan fast enough—

Another pause where Rashid would have said something. Morris unsure how to add to this.

Nina, grinning.

                    NINA
          But Yuki! If the vibration dissipates slow enough in 3-space, it might be directly absorbed.

Yuki realizing she missed it completely

                    YUKI
          As long as we can have an electron shield, we can remember.

                    Nina (still smiling)
          -if it doesn't fry our whole brain.

They start moving through.

Darius, sharp, from behind.

                    DARIUS
          Great. A solution that only works if we GET BACK to the lab building first.

The excitement dampens. They move into the next room.

INT. ROOT CUBE - ROOM FOUR - CONTINUOUS

Morris retrieves his shoe. The energy has shifted.

                    NINA
          We're working on the navigation, Darius.

                    DARIUS
          Are you? Sounds like you're planning what to do after we're already there.

Darius moves to the threshold. Takes the WRENCH from his tool pack.

The others notice—everyone else has been using shoes.

Darius throws the wrench with more force than necessary. It CLANGS on the gray floor. Nothing happens.

Yuki, carefully.

                    YUKI
          The memory shield is still important to figure out—

Darius, not looking back.

                    DARIUS
          Figure it out when we're not lost.

He moves through the threshold. The others exchange glances.

Morris, quieter now.

                    MORRIS
          I was just trying to help...

Nina turns to Morris, encouraging.

                    NINA
          You did help. This is huge.

                    YUKI
          We need to estimate the shield strength. Maybe use the building's field as a template—

Nina, fast-talking again, excited.

                    NINA
          If we can build small devices, personal shields for each person—

                    MORRIS
          It would be highly experimental. The shield could cause unintended fields. And the shield energy would need to
          dissipate in 3-space—
          (catches himself)
          Sorry, not sure where I'm going with this.

                    NINA
          Same, bro. Chen did electrical.

INT. ROOT CUBE - ROOM FIVE - CONTINUOUS

They move through. DARIUS retrieves his wrench, jaw tight.

                    DARIUS
          You need to focus on the next room. Not some theoretical device we can't build.

                    YUKI
          If we get back, we CAN build it.

                    DARIUS
          IF we get back.

He throws the wrench again—harder. CLANG. Safe.

Morris turns to Nina and Yuki, trying to continue.

                    MORRIS
          The vibration frequency would need to match three-space, but would they even line up?

Darius, turning on them.

                    DARIUS
          You're doing it again. Talking in circles about problems for LATER instead of focusing on NOW.

                    MORRIS
          I'm just—the scientific thinking is relevant—

                    DARIUS
          It's relevant when we have somewhere to apply it. Right now? It's a distraction.

Silence. Morris looks down.

Nina, quiet but firm.

                    NINA
          We can do both, Darius.

Darius doesn't respond. Moves through the threshold without waiting.

INT. ROOT CUBE - ROOM SIX - CONTINUOUS

The group follows. The easy scientific discussion is strained now.

Darius retrieves his wrench. The others watch him warily.

                    NINA
          Actually, Morris, the fact we are here now means it is a natural harmonic.

Darius, feigning interest.

                    DARIUS
          Root space is a harmonic of ours?

                    YUKI
          Kind of but the opposite.

Darius moves to the next threshold. Throws the wrench with force.

CLANG. Safe.

The others follow in quieter conversation.

Morris clutches his remaining shoe. Nina and Yuki exchange glances but don't continue their discussion.

Ahead of them, DARIUS walks alone, wrench in hand. The gap between him and the others has widened.

The group continues through identical gray spaces, together but fracturing.

FADE OUT.
