SCENE 6 - THE FINAL DEMO
=========================

LOCATION: Company lab / INZO facility (after returning from cube)

CHARACTERS:
- Yuki and Nina (the only two who remember the cube ordeal)
- Marcus (hated manager character, doesn't remember cube experience)

SCENE LAYOUT:

1. OPENING
   - Yuki and Nina back at company lab
   - Working on equipment, exhausted/traumatized from cube experience
   - They are the ONLY ones who remember everything
   - Marcus enters demanding delivery/results
   - He has NO memory of the cube (memory erasure affected him)

2. THE SETUP
   - Yuki and Nina stay calm, say they have a demo ready
   - Marcus is impatient, condescending as usual
   - Completely unaware he was in the cube with them
   - Yuki and Nina prepare the n=0.333 machine
   - They exchange knowing glances about what happened

3. THE TRAP
   - Scientists convince Marcus to step into/onto the n=0.333 machine
   - Frame it as demonstration of their "progress"
   - Marcus's ego/arrogance makes him comply
   - He has no memory of the cube deaths or his failures

4. THE ERASURE
   - Machine activates
   - One scientist (Yuki or Nina) holds pencil eraser
   - Erases Marcus from existence
   - Visual: Marcus disappears/fades as eraser moves
   - Justice for Edgar, Sofia, Chen, Rashid, Morris, Darius, and all who died

5. THE CLOSING LINE
   - Brief silence
   - One to the other: "Think they'll give us the death penalty?"
   - Ambiguous ending - are they joking? Serious? Don't care?
   - Implication: was it worth it?
   - They remember everything; he remembered nothing
   - Text on screen: "Cube will return in cube^∞ cube: fractal"

TONE: Dark, cathartic, morally ambiguous

THEMATIC RESONANCE:
- Only those who solved the memory problem remember
- Marcus's memory loss is both mercy and curse
- Yuki and Nina bear the burden of remembering all the deaths
- The erasure is revenge but also prevention
- Corporate culture literally erased
- The cube continues (sequel setup)

CHARACTER POSITIONS:
- Yuki and Nina: Traumatized survivors with full memory
- Witnessed Darius kill Morris
- Saw Marcus's failures and ego
- Carry weight of all the deaths
- Marcus: Oblivious to his crimes
- No memory of his role in the disasters
- Returns to same arrogant manager persona
- Perfect victim for erasure

EMOTIONAL LAYERS:
- Grief for the dead (only Yuki/Nina feel this)
- Anger at Marcus (who doesn't even know why)
- Exhaustion from carrying the memories alone
- Dark satisfaction in the erasure
- Uncertainty about consequences
- Acceptance of their choice

FULL SCRIPT - ACT 3, SCENE 6

================================================================================

FADE IN:

INT. INZO LABORATORY - DAY

The sterile corporate lab. Fluorescent lights hum overhead.

The group MATERIALIZES in a flash of dimensional distortion - ALEX, LEA, JOSH, MARCUS, NINA, and YUKI. They stumble,
disoriented from the transport.

Alex drops to her knees, dizzy. LEA braces herself against a wall. JOSH stands unnaturally still, eyes distant.

Marcus staggers, putting a hand to his head.

Marcus, disoriented.

                    MARCUS
          What... where...?

Nina and YUKI exchange a quick glance. They're the only ones not disoriented - they protected themselves with their
memory solution.

Nina moves quickly to MARCUS.

                    Nina
          The dimensional transport. It causes
          confusion. Come here - the calibration
          chamber will help stabilize you.

She guides MARCUS toward the n=0 device platform in the center of the lab.

YUKI moves to the control panel, hands already working the settings.

Marcus, still dazed, allows himself to be led. Nina takes the minicube from his pocket.

Marcus, confused.

                    MARCUS
          I don't... what happened?

Nina helps him onto the platform.

                    YUKI
          Just stand here. It'll help clear
          your head.

Marcus stands in the center, unsteady. ALEX is still recovering across the room, doesn't see what's happening.

YUKI's hand moves to the activation switch.

Nina picks up a PENCIL ERASER from the workstation. Pink, ordinary, deadly.

Marcus sees it through his disorientation.

                    MARCUS
          What's that for?

Nina, cold.

                    NINA
          Marks on your permanent record. None of us wanted this, but you want to make sure it continues for your bosses.

His eyes widen - a flash of understanding - but it's too late.

Yuki activates the machine.

The dimensional field BLOOMS around MARCUS. The air shimmers, reality warping.

Marcus tries to move, can't. The field is intensifying, reality compressing.

                    MARCUS
          What--

His body begins to FLATTEN. Three dimensions collapsing into two.

Marcus SCREAMS.

His depth disappears. He becomes a flat image on the platform - a 2D silhouette of a man, impossibly thin, pressed
against existence like a photograph.

Still screaming. A flat, papery sound.

Nina raises the eraser.

The field intensifies.

The 2D silhouette collapses further. MARCUS becomes a LINE on the floor - a single dimensional streak across the
platform. One inch wide, impossibly long.

The scream becomes a thin wail.

The line CONTRACTS. Pulls inward. Becomes smaller, smaller.

Until it's a DOT. A single point in the exact center of the platform.

Silence.

Nina kneels. Brings the eraser to the dot.

She erases it.

The dot disappears.

The platform is empty.

Silence.

Nina sets down the eraser. Her hand shakes.

Yuki deactivates the machine. The displays go dark.

Behind them, ALEX has recovered enough to stand. She stares at the empty platform, understanding slowly dawning.

Nina and YUKI turn to face her.

                    ALEX
          What did you do?

Nina and YUKI don't answer. They don't need to.

                    YUKI
          Think they'll give us the death
          penalty?

                    NINA
          Probably.

                    YUKI
          Worth it?

Nina thinks of MORRIS. RASHID. All the others who died and were meant to be forgotten.

                    NINA
          Yes.

Alex looks at them. Then at the empty platform. Then back.

She says nothing.

Nina looks to Josh. Josh winks knowingly.

FADE TO BLACK.

TEXT ON SCREEN:

"Cube will return in cube^∞ cube: fractal"

The text glows briefly, then FRACTURES into infinite recursive patterns, each containing the same message at smaller and
smaller scales.

The pattern continues forever.
