SCENE 3 - LEA AND JOSH'S SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION
===============================================

LOCATION: Alex's group location in root cube

CHARACTERS:
- Alex's group (3 members): Alex, Lea, Josh

SCENE LAYOUT:

1. SCIENTIFIC FOCUS - LEA'S THEORETICAL EXPLANATION
   - Lea explains their research on DIMENSIONAL NAVIGATION MECHANICS
   - Barry sent them scraps of info: "re-aligning the harmonic to the dimensional orbital"
   - Lea explains the generic theory they developed from that cryptic message:
     * Dimensional harmonics: Every n-value space vibrates at a natural harmonic frequency
     * Dimensional orbitals: Stable trajectory shells through dimensional space
     * Re-alignment principle: Must align your harmonic to match the target orbital to navigate safely
     * Why it matters: In root-space, physical direction doesn't correspond to dimensional position
     * Must navigate by orbital paths, not spatial direction
   - Writing diagrams on the cube with marker to illustrate
   - Alex observing, contributing when needed
   - Team resting in relatively safe location
   - Strategic planning session: they decide to rebuild Barry's device

2. JOSH'S TRANSFORMATION
   - Josh completely lucid when discussing science
   - No more weird/erratic talk from Act 2
   - Clear-minded and scientifically focused
   - Acts as scientific equal to Lea
   - Major character shift in Act 3

3. BARRY'S NOTEBOOK REVELATION - JOSH'S PRACTICAL DATA
   - Lea says they can't build Barry's device without more information
   - Josh produces Barry's notebook from under his clothes
   - Lea asks why he didn't show it before
   - Josh: "I didn't think it would help before"
   - After Lea's explanation, Josh has read it and now understands what they need
   - Josh explains Barry's root-space specific discoveries from the notebook:
     * THREE NUCLEI in root-space (orbitals orbit around nuclei)
     * Each nucleus generates its own orbital paths
     * The orbitals from the three nuclei overlap in certain locations
     * Where orbitals overlap = ideal zones for safe re-alignment
     * Barry's device (quantameter) measured room's distance to danger zones
     * Device determines if room is on a safe orbital path (far from danger = on orbital)
     * Josh realizes: the lab building room was where the orbitals overlap!
     * This is why the lab is stable - it's at an orbital overlap zone
     * The protection field maintains that stability
   - Alex asks if Barry gave him the notebook
   - Josh admits: he was there when Barry died
   - Barry's device (quantameter) was destroyed, but Josh got the notebook
   - Josh's clear understanding comes from combining Barry's practical data with Lea's theoretical framework
   - Now they understand both the "why" (theory) and the "how" (practice)

4. EQUIPMENT LIMITATIONS AND CAPABILITIES
   - They now have the knowledge to navigate (theory + practical data)
   - They know the lab building is at an orbital overlap zone (safest location)
   - But Barry's device (quantameter) was destroyed when he died
   - Rebuilding the quantameter would let them measure distance to danger zones
   - Need equipment from lab building to rebuild it
   - Gap between knowledge and optimal capability

5. LAB BUILDING DECISION
   - Decision to return to the lab building for multiple reasons:
     * Lab is located at orbital overlap zone (ideal for safe re-alignment)
     * Equipment to rebuild Barry's quantameter (dimensional resonance detector)
     * Lab building's protection field maintains stability at the overlap zone
     * Safe location to rest and work
   - Josh can guide them back using his knowledge from Barry
   - Strategic value: get to safest location, get equipment, rebuild quantameter
   - Group agrees to head back
   - Sets up convergence in Scene 5

TONE: Collaborative scientific focus, hope through understanding, strategic planning
CHARACTER DYNAMICS: Josh's lucidity as major asset, Lea's problem-solving leadership, team working together

================================================================================

Description:
Lea explains their research on dimensional navigation based on Barry's cryptic message about "re-aligning the harmonic to
the dimensional orbital." She covers the generic theory: dimensional harmonics, dimensional orbitals, and the
re-alignment principle. They decide to rebuild Barry's device but Lea says they need more information. Josh reveals he
has Barry's notebook hidden under his clothes. When Lea asks why he didn't share it before, Josh says he didn't think it
would help - but after her explanation, he's read it and now understands what they need. Josh shares Barry's discoveries:
root-space has THREE nuclei, each generating orbital paths that overlap in certain locations. Barry's quantameter
measured distance to danger zones to determine if rooms are on safe orbital paths. Josh realizes the lab building was
built at an orbital overlap zone - that's why it's stable. Alex asks if Barry gave him the notebook. Josh admits he was
there when Barry died - the quantameter was destroyed but he got the notebook. Josh's lucidity when discussing science is
a major shift from Act 2. They decide to return to the lab building (the safest location at orbital overlap) to rebuild
the quantameter.

Key Elements:
- Lea explains dimensional harmonics, orbitals, and re-alignment principle (generic theory)
- Josh's lucidity when discussing science (major character shift - no weird talk)
- Decision to rebuild Barry's quantameter (dimensional resonance detector)
- Josh reveals Barry's notebook hidden under his clothes
- Lea asks why not before / Josh: "didn't think it would help before"
- Josh shares: THREE nuclei in root-space, orbitals overlap at certain locations
- Barry's quantameter measured distance to danger zones (determines if on safe orbital)
- Josh's realization: lab building is at an orbital overlap zone (why it's stable)
- Alex asks if Barry gave the notebook / Josh admits he was there when Barry died
- Quantameter destroyed, but Josh got the notebook
- Group decides to return to lab building (safest location) to rebuild quantameter

Character Development:
- Josh: Completely lucid and scientifically focused in Act 3
- Clear-minded when engaged in scientific thought
- Provides valuable insights from time with Barry
- Acts as scientific equal to Lea
- Lea: Recognizes Josh's expertise
- Values his input and observations
- Problem-solving mindset

Scientific Discussion:
- Lea's generic theory (see DIMENSIONAL NAVIGATION MECHANICS in CLAUDE.md):
  * Dimensional harmonics: each n-value space has natural harmonic frequency
  * Dimensional orbitals: stable trajectory paths through dimensional space
  * Re-alignment principle: align harmonic to target orbital for safe navigation
  * In root-space, physical direction ≠ dimensional position
- Josh's root-space specific data from Barry's notebook:
  * THREE nuclei in root-space (orbitals orbit nuclei)
  * Each nucleus generates orbital paths
  * Orbitals from three nuclei overlap at certain locations
  * Orbital overlap zones = ideal for safe re-alignment
  * Barry's quantameter: measured room's distance to danger zones
  * Distance measurement determines if room is on safe orbital path
  * Josh's realization: lab building is at an orbital overlap zone
- Alex asks if Barry gave the notebook - Josh admits he was there when Barry died
- Barry's quantameter was destroyed, but Josh got the notebook
- Decision to return to lab building (orbital overlap zone) to rebuild quantameter

Group Dynamics:
- Alex's group: Alex, Lea, Josh
- Collaborative scientific approach
- Focused on understanding the cube
- Planning next steps strategically

Notes:
This scene marks Josh's complete transformation to lucidity in Act 3. Lea explains the generic theory of dimensional
navigation: harmonics, orbitals, and re-alignment (see DIMENSIONAL NAVIGATION MECHANICS in CLAUDE.md). Josh reveals he's
been hiding Barry's notebook under his clothes - didn't think it would help before, but after Lea's explanation he
understands what they need. Josh shares Barry's discoveries: THREE nuclei in root-space with overlapping orbital paths,
Barry's quantameter that measured distance to danger zones to determine safe orbital paths. Josh realizes the lab
building is at an orbital overlap zone - explaining its stability. Alex asks if Barry gave him the notebook; Josh admits
he was there when Barry died - the quantameter was destroyed but he got the notebook. The decision to return to the lab
building (safest location at orbital overlap) to rebuild the quantameter sets up the convergence in Scene 5.

FULL SCRIPT:

FADE IN:

INT. ROOT CUBE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

A gray room identical to countless others. Equipment scattered against one wall. The three survivors rest.

Alex (30s, practical leader) sits with her voice recorder. LEA (dimensional physicist, brilliant but burdened) kneels
on the floor, using a piece of metal to sketch diagrams on the cube wall.

Josh (late 20s-early 30s, lean and haunted) sits nearby, watching Lea work. He's focused, attentive - none of the cryptic
fragmentation from Act 2.

Lea, drawing circles.

                    LEA
          So before Barry... before we lost contact, he sent us data, but he was able to encode a note back. It said..

She writes on the wall: "overlap of resonance". Lea looks to Josh for recognition, but he stares blankly at the words.

                    ALEX
          What does that mean?

Lea draws a wave patterns over each other.

                    LEA (CONT'D)
          Every dimensional space has a natural harmonic frequency. n=0, n=0.333, n=3 - they all vibrate at
          different rates. Like... like musical notes. What keeps us from going back is our harmonics aren't in tune.
          Barry's re-alignment theory was this: if you can increase the energy of your harmonic vibration, you can control
          harmonic frequency. Pick it. Safe transport through dimensional space.

                    LEA
          Barry built something. A detector. If we can rebuild it, we could map the orbitals, find safe paths...

She trails off, frustrated.

                    LEA (CONT'D)
          But we don't have enough information to reconstruct it.

Silence. Josh stares at the diagrams on the wall.

Josh, slowly.

                    JOSH
          What if you did?

                    LEA
          What?

Josh reaches inside his shirt and pulls out a worn, crumpled notebook. Stares at it for a moment, then holds it out to
Lea.

Lea takes it carefully. Opens it. Her eyes widen.

                    LEA
          This is... this is Barry's notebook. His actual research notes.

She flips through pages filled with equations, diagrams, measurements.

                    JOSH
          Root-space doesn't have one nucleus. It has three.

Lea stares at him. He draws circular paths around a center point.

                    ALEX
          Nuclei? Like... the orbitals orbit around them?

                    JOSH
          Exactly. In normal dimensional space, you'd have one nucleus generating one set of orbitals. But
          here, there are three nuclei. Each one generates its own single orbital.

He takes the metal piece from Lea and draws on the wall - three center points, each with orbital rings around them.

                    JOSH (CONT'D)
          The dangerous spot is right between the three nuclei. It's safest along the orbitals. And where the orbitals
          from different nuclei overlap...the resonances overlap...

He marks the intersection points.

                    JOSH (CONT'D)
          Then the energy is low enough for safe re-alignment! Where all three orbital patterns reinforce each
          other instead of canceling out. Things should get safer as you get closer.

                    ALEX
          And if you're not?

                    LEA
          Whenever moving away from the orbital, you're increasing the gradient, you're increasing the danger.

                    JOSH
          Traps.

Beat.

                    ALEX
          So we just go to the overlap point?

                    LEA
          Because here, physical direction doesn't correspond to dimensional position. Moving through that door—

She draws 2 boxes in the circle near the nuclei.

                    LEA (CONT'D)
          —might move you closer to the orbital rooms physically, but closer to a danger zone in dimensional space. The two don't align.

Josh draws arrow random pointing out of the boxes into the middle of the nuclei.

                    JOSH
          That's why "staying put" won't be enough. When the cube re-arranges, you're not on the orbital anymore. No
          pattern. Every room is trapped. It's just waiting to wake up. Keep moving towards a lower quantum gradient.

Alex exchanges a glance with Lea. This is the most coherent Josh has been since they found him.

                    ALEX
          So if we understand the orbitals, we can navigate. But how do we measure the quantum gradient?

He opens the notebook to a specific page - a schematic of the quantameter with QUANTAMETER easily read at the top.

He pauses. Alex rolls her eyes.

                    JOSH (CONT'D)
          But if we could rebuild it with better equipment...

                    LEA
          We could improve it dramatically.

She turns pages, reading Barry's notes with growing excitement.

                    LEA (CONT'D)
          This is everything we need. Supply list, calibration specs.

She stops. Looks up at Josh.

                    LEA (CONT'D)
          Did Barry give this to you? Before he died?

Josh stares hard at the writhing on the wall. A flash of Barry's horrific dead face in Josh's memory onscreen.

Josh's expression dims.

                    JOSH
          No.

Beat.

                    JOSH (CONT'D)
          The quantameter was destroyed. Fried. But I got the notebook.

Silence. Lea reaches out, touches his hand gently.

                    LEA
          I'm sorry.

Alex stands, walks over to join them.

                    ALEX
          Can we rebuild it? The quantameter?

Lea, studying notes.

                    LEA
          With the right equipment, yes. The core component is a modified spectrometer. We'd need to hope we have the
          right parts or find somewhere...

                    ALEX
          The lab building.

                    LEA
          If we can get back there, we have everything we need.

Josh, sudden realization.

                    JOSH
          Wait.

He takes the notebook, flips to the map page. Studies it intently.

                    JOSH (CONT'D)
          The lab building room must have been where the orbitals overlap. That's why it was so safe. On the orbital, we should be able to realign.

He points to a spot on the map.

                    JOSH (CONT'D)
          It's exactly where the lab building is. That's not coincidence.

Lea, absorbing this.

                    LEA
          That's why the protection field works so well. It's not fighting against the dimensional instability
          - it's reinforced by the natural stability that's already there.

                    ALEX
          So going back to the lab building isn't just about equipment. It's the safest location in root-space.

                    JOSH
          The only place we know of. Barry expects re-alignment actually works reliably there.

He gives the notebook to Lea.

                    JOSH (CONT'D)
          If we're going to escape this place, we need to get there before the cube rearranges.

Lea nods slowly, pieces clicking into place.

                    LEA
          We rebuild the quantameter at the lab. Use it to initiate realignment. Barry was so close to coming back.

She closes the notebook carefully.

                    LEA (CONT'D)
          Josh, can you guide us back to the lab building?

                    JOSH
          If we go against the gradients, we should get there eventually.

                    ALEX
          How long?

Josh shrugs.

Alex picks up her equipment.

                    ALEX
          Then let's move while we still have energy. We rest when we reach the lab.

                    LEA (CONT'D)
          Josh, why didn't you show us this before?

                    JOSH(cryptic)
          It wasn't time.(normal) I'm sorry. I don't know. To you, it's a notebook. To me, it's the last part of Barry.
          (pause) Lea, I took this notebook off my co-worker's tortured dead body, the man who saved my life so many times in here.

He looks at her diagrams on the wall to steady himself.

Lea, breath catching.

                    LEA
          Tell me.

                    JOSH (CONT'D)
          But after hearing you explain the theory, it makes sense to try to go back. Thinking about what Marcus said. I
          don't want to everyone to die because of me.

Lea, softly, to Josh.

                    LEA
          It's good to have you back. The real you.

Josh smiles.

                    JOSH
          I don't know if I'm the same person I was. But talking about the science... it helps. Like finding a
          path through the noise.

                    LEA
          That's all we're doing here. Finding our way through.

They share a moment - the connection between them still there, despite everything.

Alex clears her throat gently.

                    ALEX
          Josh, what are we looking for to check the gradient?

Josh, focusing.

                    JOSH
          Without a quantameter, it's hard to measure. Temperature drop?

He moves to the doorway, pulls out a voltmeter with a temperature laser tool.

                    JOSH (CONT'D)
          Current reading: eighteen degrees Celsius. If the next room is sixteen or below, we're moving in the
          right direction.

                    ALEX
          And if it's warmer?

                    JOSH
          We pick a different door.

Josh measures.

                    JOSH (CONT'D)
          Fifteen point three degrees. Cooler. This is the right direction.

Alex joins them at the door.

                    ALEX
          Then we go through.

Josh steps through first, confident but cautious. Lea follows immediately.

Alex takes one last look at the room they're leaving - at Lea's diagrams on the wall - then follows her team.

FADE OUT.

                    END OF SCENE
