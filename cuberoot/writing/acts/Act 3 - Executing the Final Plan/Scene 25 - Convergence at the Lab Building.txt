   - Horror of the scale

8. THE CHOICE
   - Lea presents the choice: this cube prison or corporate prison
   - Must show profit or face consequences
   - False choice between two forms of imprisonment
   - Corporate judgment awaits if they return
   - Group weighing impossible options

9. THE DECISION
   - Group agrees to attempt return
   - Accept corporate judgment over cube death
   - Marcus's device is ready to transport them back
   - Josh has verified the calculations work

TONE: Convergence and confrontation, fear and compliance, shocking revelations, impossible choice, bittersweet decision
CHARACTER DYNAMICS: Marcus's desperate authority, Josh's lucid challenge, Nina and Yuki's hidden device and silent
distrust, group forced together by necessity

================================================================================

Description:
Lea's team (Alex, Lea, Josh) finds the room with the miniaturized lab building (1/8 scale). They cannot enter it due to
size difference.
Marcus is already there with Yuki and Nina, holding them under duress (though not overtly clear). Marcus has already
built his device
using Nina and Yuki's equipment that can transport them directly to Earth. Nina and Yuki have BUILT their protective
device (memory erasure solution from Scene 21) and have it hidden on them, but tell no one - not Marcus, not anyone. They
speak little in this scene except showing distrust of Marcus. Marcus tries to take charge but lucid Josh challenges him,
then helps verify Marcus's device calculations.
When Marcus reveals the mini-cube and activates his device, Lea is frightened into compliance. The group learns shocking
truths about the
cube and makes a difficult decision about returning.

Key Elements:
- Lea's team arrives at room with miniaturized lab building (1/8 scale)
- Cannot enter building due to size difference
- Marcus already there with Yuki and Nina
- Marcus holding them under duress (subtle, not obvious)
- Nina and Yuki have BUILT their protective device and have it hidden on them
- They tell no one about the device - keep it completely secret
- Nina and Yuki speak little except showing distrust of Marcus
- Marcus has already built device that can transport them directly to Earth
- Marcus attempts to take command
- Lucid Josh argues against Marcus's authority, then verifies device calculations
- Marcus shows mini-cube from Edgar's death
- Marcus activates device to demonstrate it works
- Lea frightened, company falls in line with Marcus
- Alex points out many other people trapped here
- Josh reveals: cube still active, still sucking people in
- Everyone shocked by this revelation
- Lea presents the choice: this cube prison or corporate prison
- Must show profit or face consequences
- Group agrees to attempt return using Marcus's device (direct transport to Earth)
- Nina and Yuki's secret device never revealed to anyone

Characters Present:
- Alex's group: Alex, Lea, Josh
- Marcus: Alone, desperate for control
- Yuki and Nina: From Darius's group (Darius and Morris dead)

Power Dynamics:
- Marcus tries to assert authority
- Josh's lucidity challenges him effectively
- Mini-cube as symbol of Edgar's death/Marcus's guilt
- Lea's fear drives group compliance
- Nina and Yuki hold secret device - ultimate power but hidden
- Nina and Yuki show distrust of Marcus through body language and few words
- They speak little except bitter comments about Marcus stealing their equipment

Major Revelations:
- Cube still active and consuming people
- Thousands potentially trapped
- Corporate consequences await if they return without profit
- Marcus's device can transport them directly back to Earth
- False choice: cube prison vs. corporate prison

Group Decision:
- Attempt to return despite risks
- Use Marcus's device (verified by Josh)
- Face corporate judgment
- Acknowledge ongoing cube threat
- Unknown what will happen to their memories

Notes:
This is the major convergence scene where all surviving groups meet. Marcus's isolation has made him desperate. The
revelation that the cube is still active raises stakes dramatically. The choice between two prisons (cube vs. corporate)
reflects the story's themes. Nina and Yuki have built their protective device (from Scene 21) and have it hidden on them
- they tell NO ONE, not even Alex or Lea. They speak little in this scene except showing distrust of Marcus through body
language and bitter comments about him stealing their equipment. Their hidden device is the ultimate secret that will
matter in Scene 6. Sets up Scene 6 where the memory protection becomes crucial.

FULL SCRIPT - ACT 3, SCENE 5

================================================================================

FADE IN:

INT. ROOT CUBE - LAB BUILDING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

A vast cubic chamber. In the center: the INZO LAB BUILDING - miniaturized to roughly 1/8 scale but intact. The familiar
structure impossibly small.

Alex, LEA, and JOSH enter from a portal. They stop, staring.

                    ALEX
          The lab building. We found it.

Lea moving closer.

                    LEA
          It's here. But it's... we can't fit through that.

The building is recognizable but impossibly small - about 1/8 scale.

                    JOSH
          Wrong scale. Need dimensional transport to get back.

Sound from another portal. They turn.

Marcus emerges, followed by NINA and YUKI. The two young mathematicians look exhausted, traumatized. MARCUS carries
technical equipment. His posture toward them subtly controlling.

Marcus, seeing Alex's group.

                    MARCUS
          You made it.

                    ALEX
          Nina. Where's the rest of your team?

                    MARCUS
          This is it.

Alex looks past him to NINA and YUKI. Something in their body language - the way they stand apart from Marcus, won't look
at him.

                    ALEX
          Where's Darius? Morris?

Yuki looks away. NINA's face tightens.

Nina, quiet, flat.

                    NINA
          Dead.

Silence.

                    ALEX
          What happened?

Nina opens her mouth, but MARCUS speaks first.

                    MARCUS
          The cube. Same as everyone else.

But NINA and YUKI exchange a glance that says there's more. A silent communication. They say nothing.

Marcus moves toward the miniaturized building.

                    MARCUS (CONT'D)
          We need to focus on getting out. I've built a dimensional transport device.

He sets down a quantameter - a complex device built around various components.

                    MARCUS (CONT'D)
          Better than Barry's prototype. This can take us home.

Alex looks at the device skeptically.

                    ALEX
          You built that alone?

Marcus glances at NINA and YUKI.

                    MARCUS
          I had resources.

NINA's jaw clenches. YUKI's hands ball into fists.

Nina, quiet, bitter.

                    NINA
          He used our equipment.

Yuki, voice tight.

                    YUKI
          Took it.

                    MARCUS
          I needed tools. You two weren't using them.

Nina, low, controlled anger.

                    NINA
          That equipment was ours.

Nina and YUKI stand close together, protective of each other. They keep one hand near their pockets - something small
hidden there. They exchange another glance but reveal nothing.

Josh moves forward, voice cutting through.

                    JOSH
          You don't give orders here.

Marcus turns, annoyed.

                    MARCUS
          Josh, I'm still head of Quantum Logistics--

Josh, suddenly lucid, sharp.

                    JOSH
          Your team is dead, Marcus. Barry. Sofia. Chen. Rashid. Edgar. All dead. You led them here and they died.

                    MARCUS
          I didn't put anyone here.

                    JOSH
          Didn't we though?

The casual brutality hits everyone. JOSH's eyes clear, focused.

                    MARCUS
          I'm trying to get us out--

                    JOSH
          You're trying to maintain control. There's a difference.

Lea watches, tension visible. ALEX sees her old friend caught between impossible positions.

Alex turns to Josh.

                    ALEX
          Can you verify his device? Make sure it's safe?

Josh looks at the device Marcus built.

                    JOSH
          If it's wrong, I'll fix it.

Marcus hands over the quantameter.

Josh examines it.

Nina and YUKI watch silently. Their hands still near their pockets. Another glance between them - a shared secret they
keep entirely to themselves.

Marcus reaches into his pocket. Pulls out something small and metallic.

The MINI-CUBE from Edgar's death. Tiny, dense, impossible.

Everyone stares.

Lea, voice tight.

                    LEA
          Is that--

                    MARCUS
          A cube. A very small one. How much sof-tak to keep this fed?

He holds up the tiny object.

                    MARCUS (CONT'D)
          It's coming with us.

He looks at NINA and YUKI.

                    MARCUS (CONT'D)
          Your mathematical models made it possible.

Nina, quiet, controlled fury.

                    NINA
          Leave the math out of this.

Marcus activates the device. The room HUMS with energy. Subtle vibration.

Lea steps back, fear flashing across her face.

                    LEA
          Marcus, be careful--

                    MARCUS
          The device is ready. It can transport us directly back to Earth.

Alex sees LEA's fear.

                    ALEX
          Lea?

Lea won't meet her eyes.

Lea, quietly, to Alex.

                    LEA
          We should listen to him.

Alex moves toward the miniature building, breaking tension.

                    ALEX
          We're not the only ones here. All the other prisoners who disappeared - they're still here somewhere.

                    LEA
          We have no control. There's nothing left to do here.

Nina, quiet horror.

                    NINA
          Hundreds of people trapped in here.

Yuki, voice small.

                    YUKI
          Thousands.

Alex looks at the walls of the cube.

                    ALEX
          And we're supposed to just leave them?

Lea steps forward, voice heavy with resignation.

                    LEA
          What choice do we have?

                    YUKI
          If we get back, we could make them shut it down--

Lea, cutting her off.

                    LEA
          And then what? You think INZO will let us walk away?

Silence. Everyone knows she's right.

                    LEA (CONT'D)
          If we make it back, we have to show profit. Make this worth their investment. Or we become liabilities.

Alex, quiet anger.

                    ALEX
          Corporate prison instead of cube prison.

                    LEA
          At least corporate prison we might survive.

Nina looks between them, idealism cracking.

Nina, quiet.

                    NINA
          So we're just... giving up?

YUKI's voice is small, traumatized.

                    YUKI
          I just want to remember. Morris. Rashid. Everyone who died. I don't want them to erase us.

Nina reaches for YUKI's hand. They grip each other tightly.

Another glance between them. Hands near their pockets. The secret device hidden. They say nothing.

Marcus moves back to his device.

                    MARCUS
          If you had solved the memory erasure, then maybe you could.

                    ALEX
          We don't have to go through the building?

                    MARCUS
          The building is just a landmark. My device can transport us to the target harmonic directly.

Alex looks at the miniaturized building, then at the fractured group.

                    ALEX
          We try to get back. Then we deal with INZO. However we have to.

                    LEA
          Use Marcus's device. We get out.

Josh speaks, rough voice certain.

                    JOSH
          Only through. Never out.

Marcus makes final adjustments to his device.

                    MARCUS
          The dimensional transport will take all of us back simultaneously.

Nina and YUKI exchange glances. Their hands near their pockets. Their secret remains theirs.

Alex watches the group come together - fractured, traumatized, unified by need to escape.

The miniaturized lab building sits before them. A landmark. A symbol.

The cube hums around them, indifferent and eternal.

FADE OUT.
