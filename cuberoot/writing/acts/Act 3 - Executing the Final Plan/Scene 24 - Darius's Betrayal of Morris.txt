================================================================================

Description:
Darius's group passes through 3 offscreen rooms and enters room 8, excited about solving the memory erasure problem.
Morris makes jokes that make Nina and Yuki laugh, annoying Darius. They test room 9 and all enter, but the door
closes—freeze fog erupts from the center. They navigate along walls to the exit. Yuki and Nina escape through. Darius
is halfway through when Morris says "We'll take care of you if you're hurt"—Darius kicks him into the fog. Morris
freezes back-to-front while moving and shatters on impact. Nina and Yuki shove Darius back into the fog. He floats
frozen through the dense fog and shatters against the far wall.

Key Elements:
- Room 8: Excitement about electron shield solution, Morris making jokes
- Nina and Yuki laughing, Darius growing annoyed
- Darius tests room 9 with wrench - appears safe

- Freeze fog erupts from center bottom door, dissipates against walls
- Navigate along walls to exit door
- Yuki through first, Nina second, Darius halfway through (shoe freezes)
- Morris below: "We'll take care of you if you're hurt"
- Darius KICKS Morris into center fog
- Morris freezes BACK to FRONT while still moving - SHATTERS on floor
- Darius turning horizontal in doorway, lowering down ladder
- Nina and Yuki on each side SHOVE him back into fog
- Darius FLOATS (dense cold fog), freezes mid-air
- Slams into far wall, SHATTERS
- Door opens, fog stops, Nina/Yuki in room 10 traumatized

Character Arcs:
- Darius: Reveals true sociopathic nature
- Cold survival pragmatism becomes murderous
- Ultimate betrayal of team member
- Morris: Victim of Darius's cruelty
- Was trying to maintain morale and offer help

FULL SCRIPT - ACT 3, SCENE 24

================================================================================

FADE IN:

INT. ROOT CUBE - ROOM EIGHT - CONTINUOUS

A safe gray room. DARIUS, MORRIS, NINA, and YUKI stand catching their breath after navigating three rooms since Scene 21.

The energy has shifted - no longer the strained tension from before. NINA and YUKI are animated, excited.

                    NINA
          If we can build the devices small
          enough, we could each wear one. Personal
          memory shields.

                    YUKI
          The electron frequency just has to
          match the baseline harmonic. We
          measured that back at the lab building.

                    MORRIS
          So, I mean, theoretically when we
          get back, we'll actually remember
          this? All of it? (nervous laugh)
          Not sure if that's a blessing or...
          well, definitely not a curse, but--

Nina, grinning.

                    NINA
          We'll remember, Morris. Everything.

Morris smiles, warming to the hope.

                    MORRIS
          First thing I'm doing is filing a
          very detailed complaint with HR. I
          mean, assuming HR still exists and
          isn't also trapped in some fractional
          dimension which... (catches himself)
          Sorry, that's probably not funny.

Yuki laughs anyway - genuine, relieved.

                    YUKI
          It's a little funny.

                    NINA
          When we testify about what INZO did,
          they can't just memory-wipe us and
          make it disappear.

Darius watches from near the next threshold, jaw tight. His hands clench the wrench.

                    DARIUS
          Next room.

He throws the wrench through the threshold. It clangs on gray floor. Nothing happens.

Darius steps through without waiting.

INT. ROOT CUBE - ROOM NINE - CONTINUOUS

The others follow. Another identical gray room.

Nina removes her shoe, tosses it through the next threshold.

The shoe lands safely on gray floor.

                    NINA
          Looks clear.

They move toward the threshold together.

All four step through into the next room.

The DOOR behind them SLAMS SHUT - trapping all four inside.

                    MORRIS
          What--

FREEZE FOG erupts from the center bottom door - a white mist that radiates extreme cold.

All four jump back against the walls.

The fog billows outward from the center, but as it reaches the walls it dissipates to normal temperature.

                    DARIUS
          Stay against the walls!

                    YUKI
          The far door! We need to get to the far
          door!

Nina and YUKI press themselves flat against the wall, breathing hard.

The fog continues pouring from the center door - a column of white that fills the middle of the room but leaves the edges
passable.

Nina moves along the wall toward the exit door first. YUKI follows close behind.

Darius and MORRIS move along the opposite wall.

                    MORRIS
          Is it... is the temperature actually--

                    DARIUS
          Just move.

Nina reaches the exit door. Grabs the ladder rungs. The door is closed.

She starts climbing up the rungs to position herself to crawl through when it opens.

The door OPENS.

Nina crawls through to the other side.

Yuki climbs up the ladder next. Crawls through after NINA.

INT. ROOT CUBE - ROOM TEN - CONTINUOUS

Nina and YUKI stand in the safe room, relief flooding their faces.

Nina, calling back through door.

                    NINA
          Come on!

BACK IN ROOM NINE:

Darius is halfway through the threshold, horizontal on the ladder, head and shoulders through, legs still in the fog
room.

Morris is below him on the wall, waiting his turn.

DARIUS's shoe brushes the edge of the freeze fog.

The shoe FREEZES SOLID instantly - ice coating the leather.

Darius jerks his foot back. The frozen shoe scrapes against the ladder rung.

Morris looks up at him.

                    MORRIS
          Are you okay? Did it--

Darius doesn't respond. Continues pulling himself through.

Morris steps closer to the ladder below him.

                    MORRIS
          Are you— I mean, if you need help
          getting through, I can— we can help
          you. But you have to ask, right?
          Because technically we're all going
          to need each other's help to—

Darius stops moving.

He turns his head to look back at MORRIS.

Something in his tone shifts - almost conversational.

                    DARIUS
          You can help me?

Morris nods. Through the doorway, NINA and YUKI watch, uncertain.

                    DARIUS (CONT'D)
          All I have to do is ask?

                    MORRIS
          Darius, of course—

Darius, cold, final.

                    DARIUS
          I am DONE asking.

Before MORRIS can process the words, DARIUS KICKS backward with his frozen shoe.

His foot catches MORRIS in the chest.

Morris stumbles backward off the wall - arms windmilling - falling toward the center of the room.

He falls BACKWARD into the freeze fog, facing the others.

The fog hits his back first.

MORRIS's body begins to FREEZE from back to front - still moving as the ice spreads forward through his torso.

His mouth opens in a scream but no sound comes - his lungs already frozen.

His eyes lock on NINA and YUKI through the doorway - terrified, confused, betrayed.

The freezing reaches his face - ice crystallizing across his features mid-expression.

Morris hits the floor completely frozen.

He SHATTERS on impact - fragmenting into pieces of ice and frozen tissue.

Nina, screaming.

                    NINA
          MORRIS!

                    YUKI
          NO!

Darius has turned in the doorway - now horizontal, head pointing back toward the fog room, legs extending into the safe
room.

He starts lowering himself down the ladder into Room Ten.

Nina and YUKI stand on either side of the doorway.

Their eyes meet - a split-second of communication.

They both know what the other is thinking.

Agreement passes between them without words.

DARIUS's hands grip the rungs as he lowers himself.

                    DARIUS
          He was weak. Survival of the--

Nina shoves his shoulder HARD.

Yuki shoves his other shoulder simultaneously.

The combined force sends DARIUS backward through the threshold - back into the fog room.

He FLOATS through the air - the shove was so powerful, or the dense cold fog provides less resistance.

His body begins to FREEZE mid-flight as it passes through the space where MORRIS shattered.

Ice spreads across his skin, his clothes, his shocked expression.

He slams into the far wall HEAD FIRST - completely frozen.

Darius SHATTERS against the wall - exploding into frozen fragments.

The door between the rooms SLAMS SHUT.

The freeze fog stops.

INT. ROOT CUBE - ROOM TEN - CONTINUOUS

Nina and YUKI stand in the safe room, breathing hard.

Silence.

Through the closed door, they can see nothing. The room where MORRIS and DARIUS died is sealed.

Yuki, voice very small.

                    YUKI
          We just...

                    NINA
          He killed Morris.

                    YUKI
          I know.

YUKI's hands shake. NINA's face is pale, eyes haunted.

They stand there, not moving. Two young scientists left alone.

Nina, quiet.

                    NINA
          We need to keep moving.

Yuki silent, not moving.

Beat. NINA's eyes focus on something internal.

                    NINA (CONT'D)
          I felt it. When he asked those
          questions— "You can help me? All I
          have to do is ask?" I knew something
          was wrong. But I didn't—

                    YUKI
          I felt it too. His tone was...off.

Nina, voice breaking.

                    NINA
          I should have said something. I should
          have warned Morris—

                    YUKI
          Don't. Don't do that to yourself. We
          couldn't have stopped him.

Nina shakes her head, grief and anger warring on her face.

                    NINA
          It's all been wrong. From the
          beginning. INZO, the company, using
          root-space to trap prisoners— using
          PEOPLE like they're disposable—

She looks at YUKI with sudden intensity.

                    NINA (CONT'D)
          But we have a way to tear it all down.

Yuki stares at her.

                    NINA (CONT'D)
          The memory shields. We figured it out.
          Morris helped us figure it out. We can
          get back to the lab building, build the
          devices, and when we return— we'll
          remember. Everything.

                    YUKI
          Nina—

                    NINA
          They can't have this. INZO can't have
          root-space, can't keep using it to make
          people disappear. And we can't let them
          make US disappear. We have to get back,
          we have to make sure the truth gets
          out— to the public, to everyone. What
          this company really is. What they've
          done.

Her voice gains strength, conviction cutting through the grief.

                    NINA (CONT'D)
          We CAN save the people still trapped
          here. We CAN make it right. But only if
          we remember. Only if we get the truth
          out before they silence us.

Yuki, quiet, but certain.

                    YUKI
          Then we make sure we remember.

Nina nods. Something has shifted— grief hardening into purpose.

Yuki wipes her eyes roughly with the back of her hand.

                    YUKI
          The lab building. We still need to
          find it.

Nina nods slowly. Forces herself to focus.

                    NINA
          Just us now.

                    YUKI
          Just us.

Then NINA straightens. Forces herself forward.

                    NINA
          Come on.

Yuki follows. They move toward the next threshold.

Behind them, the door to Room Nine remains closed.

Morris and DARIUS are gone.

The cube shifts around them, indifferent to their grief.

FADE OUT.
