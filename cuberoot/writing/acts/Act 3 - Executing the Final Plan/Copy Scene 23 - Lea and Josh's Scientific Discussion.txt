FADE IN:

INT. ROOT CUBE - RELATIVELY SAFE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

A gray room like any other, but this one has been tested. Safe, for now. Equipment salvaged from the lab building sits against one wall.

ALEX (30s, practical and focused) leans against the wall, voice recorder in hand. She watches as LEA
 (dimensional physicist, burdened but brilliant) sketches diagrams on the floor with a piece of metal.

JOSH (late 20s-early 30s, lean and intense) kneels beside Lea, examining the diagrams. He's utterly focused—none of
the cryptic, fragmented energy from Act 2. Just clarity.

                    LEA
               (pointing to diagram)
          So the dimensional saturation follows a gradient pattern. Higher concentration near the core, dissipating toward the boundaries.

                    JOSH
          That matches what Barry observed. He mapped the saturation levels across seventeen different zones before...

He pauses, then continues matter-of-factly.

                    JOSH (CONT'D)
          Before we had to keep moving. The pattern was consistent—exponential decay from center points.

                    ALEX
               (from her position)
          Multiple centers?

                    JOSH
               (nodding)
          At least three that we documented. Possibly more. Each one generating its own field overlap.

Lea sketches additional markings on her diagram.

                    LEA
          Which would explain the interference patterns. When fields intersect, they don't cancel—they compound.

                    JOSH
          Exactly. Barry theorized that's why some rooms are more unstable than others. They sit at intersection points where multiple fields create constructive interference.

                    LEA
               (looking up at him)
          You're... you're really clear on all this.

                    JOSH
               (slight smile, self-aware)
          Science makes sense. The rest...

He gestures vaguely at the walls.

                    JOSH (CONT'D)
          The rest is harder to process. But the physics? That I can work with.

Alex exchanges a glance with Lea. This Josh is radically different from the cryptic survivor they found in Act 2.

                    ALEX
          What else did Barry figure out?

Josh shifts to sitting, pulls out a crumpled notebook—Barry's. He opens it carefully.

                    JOSH
          He was mapping the relationship between n-values and physical space. Look—

He points to a page of equations and sketches.

                    JOSH (CONT'D)
          At three-space, normal reality. At root-space, the lab building's pocket dimension. But in between? There are gradients. Transitional zones.

                    LEA
               (leaning in)
          We suspected that, but we never had proof.

                    JOSH
          Barry measured it. He used the dimensional resonance detector—you know, the one he built from the spectrometer parts?

                    LEA
          The jerryrigged device that kept shorting out?

                    JOSH
               (small laugh—remarkably normal)
          That's the one. He got it stable eventually. The readings showed discrete dimensional layers, like... geological strata. We could move between them if we understood the transition mechanics.

Lea sits back, absorbing this.

                    LEA
          That's how you survived. You weren't just wandering randomly—you were navigating dimensionally.

                    JOSH
          We tried. It worked about sixty percent of the time. The other forty percent...

His expression darkens briefly, then clears.

                    JOSH (CONT'D)
          The other forty percent is why Barry's not here.

Silence. Alex clicks off her recorder.

                    ALEX
          I'm sorry.

                    JOSH
               (factual, not cold)
          He understood the risks. We both did. The point is, the data exists. His observations were sound.

He taps the notebook.

                    JOSH (CONT'D)
          If we can replicate his measurements with better equipment, we could map safe routes. Maybe even predict room configurations before entering them.

                    LEA
          The lab building has the equipment we'd need.

                    JOSH
          The protection field generator there also provides a stable baseline for measurements. We'd need that as a reference point.

Alex stands, walks over to join them.

                    ALEX
          So we go back.

                    LEA
          It's risky. We've been moving away from it, and navigating back—

                    JOSH
          —is exactly what I did with Barry for three weeks. I know the tricks. The patterns.

He looks at the two women.

                    JOSH (CONT'D)
          I can get us there. Not perfectly, not guaranteed, but better odds than random movement.

Lea studies him for a long moment.

                    LEA
          You're really back, aren't you? The Josh I knew before.

                    JOSH
               (considering)
          I don't know about that. I'm not the same. But when I focus on the science? The noise quiets. I can think clearly.

He gestures to the notebook.

                    JOSH (CONT'D)
          This helps. Barry's work gives me something concrete to hold onto. Something that makes sense when nothing else does.

                    ALEX
               (practical)
          What do we need from the lab building specifically?

                    LEA
          The resonance detector Barry built. The field generator's diagnostic equipment. And the computer that's hopefully still logging dimensional fluctuation data.

                    JOSH
          Plus physical supplies. The protection field there means we can rest without constantly watching for room shifts.

                    ALEX
          How long to get back?

                    JOSH
               (calculating)
          If we move carefully? Eight to twelve room transitions. We'd need to test each threshold, watch for saturation spikes, avoid the high-interference zones...

He pauses, then adds with unusual directness.

                    JOSH (CONT'D)
          Four hours. Maybe six if we're cautious.

Lea and Alex exchange looks.

                    ALEX
          That's more specific than anything we've been able to plan.

                    JOSH
          I've done it before. Different starting point, same destination. The dimensional topology is consistent enough to navigate if you know what to look for.

                    LEA
          Temperature gradients?

                    JOSH
          That's one marker. Also electromagnetic field strength, visual distortion at thresholds, and the acoustic resonance—rooms closer to the lab building have a different echo pattern.

Lea nods slowly.

                    LEA
          Barry taught you well.

                    JOSH
               (quiet)
          He kept us alive for three weeks. I learned from the best.

Beat.

                    ALEX
          Okay. We go back to the lab building. Get the equipment. Try to gather enough data to make sense of this place.

                    LEA
          And if we can map it properly, we might be able to find Marcus. Or the others.

                    JOSH
          The communication attempt Marcus mentioned—if we can boost the signal with the lab's equipment, we might establish contact with whoever's still out there.

He stands, helps Lea to her feet.

                    JOSH (CONT'D)
               (to Lea, with unexpected warmth)
          It's good to work with you again. Like old times.

                    LEA
               (softly)
          Yeah. It is.

They share a moment of connection—the unspoken feelings between them visible but unvoiced.

Alex picks up her equipment, checking their supplies.

                    ALEX
          Let's move while we still have momentum. Josh, you lead. Tell us what you're looking for at each threshold.

                    JOSH
               (nodding, confident)
          Watch for the thermal drop. That's the first sign we're heading the right direction.

He moves to the doorway, examines the threshold with clear, analytical focus.

                    JOSH (CONT'D)
               (calling back)
          Transition looks clean. Minimal distortion. This is a good starting point.

Lea joins him, pulls out a small device.

                    LEA
          I'm reading eighteen degrees Celsius. What should we expect next room?

                    JOSH
          If we're heading toward the lab building? Sixteen, maybe fifteen. The protection field pulls heat from the surrounding dimensional space.

                    ALEX
               (joining them)
          That's actually useful information.

                    JOSH
               (slight smile)
          That's the idea.

He steps through the threshold first, confident and clear-minded.

Lea follows, then Alex. They move as a team—focused, purposeful, collaborative.

For the first time since entering the cube, they have a concrete plan and the expertise to execute it.

FADE OUT.
