INT. INZO FACILITY - HALLWAY OUTSIDE EDGAR'S OFFICE - DAY

MARCUS (late 30s, focused, pragmatic) stands in the hallway, arms crossed, watching a WALL-MOUNTED SCREEN.

ON SCREEN: Corporate video with sleek graphics shows rotating 3D models of cube structures. Professional NARRATOR
voice-over.

                    NARRATOR (V.O.)
          Quantum Logistics Division continues
          to pioneer dimensional efficiency
          solutions, optimizing space-time
          resource allocation for modern
          correctional infrastructure.

The video shows sanitized animations of prisoners entering cube rooms - looks safe, clean, futuristic.

                    NARRATOR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          Our proprietary n-dimensional
          containment systems provide cost-
          effective solutions...

The video shows prisoners in mess hall each with a sof-tak ball on their plate.

                    NARRATOR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          for maintaining humane environments for our users...

Marcus lets out a quiet, bitter laugh. Shakes his head slightly.

                    MARCUS
               (under breath)
          Humane.

The office door with sign "Head of Logistics" opens. A BUSINESS EXECUTIVE exits, shaking hands with EDGAR (50s, polished, corporate VP in pressed
suit).

                    EDGAR
          Great, let's circle back on those
          KPIs next week. Really appreciate
          your bandwidth on this.

                    EXECUTIVE
          Absolutely. Synergy across divisions

The two do a hand wave/shake to symbolize synergy flowing and both laugh. The Executive leaves. Edgar notices Marcus, his
demeanor brightens.

                    EDGAR
          Marcus! Mr. Quantum! Perfect timing. Come on in.

Marcus follows Edgar into the office.

INT. EDGAR'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Typical corporate VP office - motivational posters, awards, organized desk. Edgar gestures to a chair as he settles
behind his desk.

                    EDGAR
          So, you know I'm just regular logistics
          and this quantum stuff is all new to me.
          Jefe there had some worries so I'll be
          more hands-on. Now give me the full
          breakdown.

Marcus shifts uncomfortably, shifts into science explanation mode.

                    MARCUS
          The extraction is showing promise.
          We're seeing  information come
          through with more frequency and--

                    EDGAR
               (interrupting, friendly)
          Sorry, I should clarify. I meant the
          team transition. How's the integration
          going?

Beat. Marcus recalibrates and relaxes, since he does not have to explain yet.

                    MARCUS
          Right. The team.

                    EDGAR
          The science stuff, that's your
          department. I trust you've got it
          handled. I'm more concerned with
          the dollarinos. I don't want these
          guys getting paid to do nothing.

                    MARCUS
               (measured)
          The integration is... proceeding.
          We're bringing in Alex and three others
          from Food Science. Their experience
          with dimensional compression
          could translate well.

Edgar pulls up a tablet, scrolling through what appears to be an org chart.

                    EDGAR
          And knowing dimensional compression
          helps with your re-biggification?

                    MARCUS
          Yes..technically.

                    EDGAR
          Perfect. We'll all avoid en-shit-
          ification then.
               (laughs)
          Alex, yes. I see that name a lot
          for sof-tak.

Marcus's expression darkens slightly at the mention of sof-tak - he considers it far beneath his level.

                    MARCUS
          She's competent. They all are.

                    EDGAR
          And they're up to speed?

                    MARCUS
          We're coordinating currently. The
          team meeting starts in a few minutes.
          First session with the combined group.

Edgar stands, grabbing his tablet.

                    EDGAR
               (nodding approvingly)
          I'm actually free should sit in on
          that. Good to show leadership support
          during transitions. Plus, on the
          ground level you can see the real dirt.

Marcus stands as well, a flicker of concern crosses his face.

                    MARCUS
          It's going to be fairly technical.
          Dimensional mathematics, quantum
          containment protocols--

                    EDGAR
               (seriously)
          I also need to make sure the team is
          run well. Since we're giving Quantum
          Logistics these resources, we're
          expecting you can hit all Q3
          deliverables. Or we're both
          going to need to explain.

Edgar moves toward the door, Marcus follows with visible hesitation.

                    EDGAR (CONT'D)
               (calmly)
          But you just make sure everyone keeps
          attacking the crap pile, keep them
          working toward the same goal.

                    MARCUS
          De-shittification?

                    EDGAR
               (smiling, pointing at Marcus)
          Close. Profit maximization!

Marcus pauses at the door, something unspoken in his expression.

                    MARCUS
               (uncertain smile)
          Synergy.

But the way he says it suggests he doesn't quite believe it.

                    EDGAR
          Synergy indeed.

They exit the office together. Edgar cheerful and oblivious, starting to describe old transitions. Marcus carrying the
weight of what he knows.

FADE OUT.
