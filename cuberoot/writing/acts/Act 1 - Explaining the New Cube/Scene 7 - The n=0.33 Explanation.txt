SCENE 7 - THE n=0.333... EXPLANATION
====================================

LOCATION: Quantum Logistics wing, secure briefing room

CHARACTERS:
- MARCUS - Head of Quantum Logistics
- EDGAR - Corporate VP of Logistics
- ALEX - Food scientist, protagonist
- LEA - Dimensional expert

SCENE LAYOUT:

1. CONTINUING THE BRIEFING (PRIVATE)
   - Lea and Alex return from coffee break
   - Only the 4 of them in the room now (Marcus, Edgar, Alex, Lea)
   - Marcus continues presentation
   - Visual aids/diagrams showing dimensional concepts

2. INTRODUCTION OF n=0.333...
   - Marcus introduces the n=0.333... (cube root) dimension
   - Theoretically and mathematically possible
   - The quantum team thought they understood it

3. THE n=0.333... PROBLEM
   - Successful experiments storing and getting OBJECTS out
   - Can't get PEOPLE out
   - Physical limitations weren't realized until after experiments began
   - Worked on different approaches
   - Company wants synergy across departments (why Alex is here)

4. ALEX'S REACTIONS
   - Alex processes the information
   - Questions about what this means
   - Growing concern about the implications

5. EDGAR'S THREAT
   - Alex objects to the assignment
   - Edgar interrupts
   - She can quit but company will probably smear her
   - Not Edgar personally - there's a whole dept for that
   - Alex quiets down

6. EDGAR TELLS MARCUS TO CONTINUE
   - Edgar directs Marcus to keep going
   - Emphasizes need for results

7. THE STAKES QUESTION
   - Alex asks: is it prisoners or employees in n=0.333...?
   - Marcus: "It doesn't matter"
   - Edgar agrees: if n=0.333... is not profitable, they'll all be sent to cube
   - Threat hangs in the air

TONE: Exposition heavy, growing dread, corporate threat, intimate and tense
DYNAMICS: Marcus as technical expert, Edgar as corporate enforcer, Alex realizing the danger, Lea burdened by knowledge
KEY TENSION: What are the physical limitations? Who is trapped? What happens if they fail?

TECHNICAL FOCUS:
- n=0 (singularity/zero-space): Point-dimension where people are alive but trapped
- n=4 (hyperspace): Fourth dimension (tesseract)
- n=0.333 (root-space): Cube root dimension - theoretically possible, physical limitations not understood
- Edgar asks what the dimensional notation means; Marcus explains the colloquial terms
- After this scene, characters use colloquial terms in dialogue

NOTES:
This scene is heavy on exposition but crucial for audience understanding of the dimensional mechanics that will drive the
plot. The shift from n=0.5 to n=0.333... reflects the "cube root" concept of the title.

========================================
CONDENSED DESCRIPTION:
========================================

Alex and Lea return from their coffee break to find themselves in a smaller, secure briefing room with only Marcus and
Edgar - the rest of the team has been excluded. Marcus reveals the true project: the n=0.333... (one-third) dimension.
While they can successfully retrieve objects from this fractional dimension, people who enter cannot be extracted. When
Alex objects to the assignment and tries to decline, Edgar calmly threatens her with the company's "competitive
intelligence department" that handles departures and references. Alex backs down. When she asks whether those trapped are
prisoners or employees, Marcus responds "Does it matter?" Edgar casually reveals that if the project fails, everyone on
the team will be sent to the cube themselves - company policy to turn failed projects into test cases. The threat
establishes the stakes: solve this or become the research subjects.

                    SCREENPLAY
          ========================================

INT. QUANTUM LOGISTICS BUILDING - CONFERENCE ROOM

Marcus stands at the front with a presentation screen. Edgar sits at the head of the table,
tablet out. Lea and Alex enter together, coffee in hand.

The door closes behind them with a heavy CLICK.

Alex feels worried now.

                    ALEX
          Time for the fun stuff?

Marcus and Edgar exchange a glance.

                    MARCUS
          What we're about to discuss is need-to-
          know. For now, that's the four of us.

Lea sits down, composed but tense. Alex hesitates, then takes a seat across from her.

The slide is still on n=0 explanation.

                    MARCUS (CONT'D)
          The n=0 cube - zero-space - has
          been our primary money maker.

 Marcus clicks and n=0.333 is shown - complex mathematical equations and dimensional diagrams.

                    MARCUS (CONT'D)
          But we've been working on something
          else. Something we thought we understood.

He clicks to the next slide. A strange, fractional dimensional diagram.

                    MARCUS (CONT'D)
          N equals zero point three three three,
          repeating. One-third dimension.

Alex stares at the diagram, her scientific mind trying to process it.

Edgar squints at the screen, confused.

                    EDGAR
          Wait. N equals what now? Is that like...
          math notation? What does that actually
          mean?

Marcus glances at him, then realizes he needs to translate.

                    MARCUS
          Right. Dimensional notation. N is the
          number of dimensions. N=3 is three-space
          - our normal reality. Three dimensional.

He clicks to show a simple diagram.

                    MARCUS (CONT'D)
          N=4 is hyperspace - the tesseract,
          fourth dimension. N=0 is a singularity
          - zero-space, a single point. We've
          been calling it that for years.

Edgar nods, following along.

                    MARCUS (CONT'D)
          This - n=0.333 - we're calling root-
          space. Cube root. One-third dimension.

                    EDGAR
          Root-space. Okay. That I can remember.

He clicks to show bar graph of density comparing zero-space and root-space with root space much higher.

                    MARCUS
          In zero-space things are sizeless, but in root-space we can stack sizeless things.

Alex processes this, her scientific mind working through the implications.

                    ALEX
          A fractional dimension?

                    MARCUS
          Theoretically and mathematically
          possible. And now... the possibilities are endless.

Lea's hands tighten around her coffee cup.

Marcus clicks to add things to the slide - test results, success rates.

                    MARCUS (CONT'D)
          We've successfully stored and retrieved
          objects. Small items.

                    ALEX
          But not people.

Beat. Marcus meets her eyes.

                    MARCUS
          No. Not people. We'd ideally start with mice, but..

                    ALEX
          What happens to them?

                    LEA
          They go in. We just... can't get them
          out.

Her voice is tight, controlled. Alex glances at her friend - this is what's been weighing on her.

                    MARCUS
          The physical limitations weren't
          realized until after the incident. We've tried
          different approaches, but the uncertainty is too high. Dimensional anchoring,
          temporal phasing—

                    ALEX
          And that's why you need food science?

Edgar leans forward, interested in where this is going.

                    MARCUS
          We need fresh perspectives. Different
          expertise. The company thinks there's
          synergy potential between molecular
          compression and dimensional storage.

Alex processes this. Her practical mind working through the implications.

                    ALEX
          How many people are in there?

Silence. Marcus looks at Lea. Lea looks down at her coffee.

                    MARCUS
          Classified.

                    ALEX
          You're asking me to help extract people
          you won't tell me about, using science
          I don't understand, for a project that's
          already failed.

Her voice is direct, not hostile - just stating facts.

                    ALEX (CONT'D)
          I can't help with this. I'm sorry, but
          molecular compression doesn't translate
          to dimensional physics. You need
          mathematicians, not food scientists.

Edgar sets down his tablet with a deliberate CLICK.

                    EDGAR
          You're free to decline the assignment,
          Alex. Walk away. Find another job.

He says it pleasantly, almost kindly.

                    EDGAR (CONT'D)
          But I should mention - the company has
          a whole department dedicated to
          competitive intelligence. They handle
          departures. Exit interviews. References.
          Social media management.

Alex meets his eyes, understanding the threat.

                    EDGAR (CONT'D)
          Not me, personally. I just do the
          dollarinos and KPIs. But they're very
          thorough.

Beat. Alex looks to Lea. Lea won't meet her eyes.

Alex sits back down, slowly.

                    ALEX
          I understand.

Edgar smiles, satisfied.

                    EDGAR
          Great. Marcus, continue.

Marcus's expression doesn't change.

                    MARCUS
          We need round the clock testing to fully
          calibrate retrieval. Edgar's boss wants
          results by end of quarter.

                    ALEX
          So you're risking us getting trapped in there?

The question hangs in the air. Marcus stops mid-presentation.

                    MARCUS
          Like I said, retrieval will be complete by
          end of quarter. So does it matter?

                    ALEX
          Of course it matters.

                    MARCUS
          We're trying to get them out. That's
          what matters. Their original status is—

                    EDGAR
          (interrupting)
          If this root-space doesn't become profitable,
          we all get sent to the cube anyway.

He says it casually, checking his tablet.

                    EDGAR (CONT'D)
          Company policy. Failed projects get
          turned into test cases. Very efficient.

Alex goes very still. Lea's hands are shaking now.

                    LEA
          He's not joking.

                    EDGAR
          Nope. Jefe made it very clear. Results
          or we become the research. Synergy in,
          synergy out.

He does a small synergy hand gesture, completely oblivious to the horror of what he's saying.

The threat hangs in the air. Alex looks at Marcus, searching for reassurance. He meets her eyes - honest, direct.

                    MARCUS
          We need to make this work. All of us.

FADE TO BLACK.
