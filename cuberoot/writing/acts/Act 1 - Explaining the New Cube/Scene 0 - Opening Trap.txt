======================

LOCATION: Root cube trap room - dimensional transporter trap

CHARACTERS:
- Unknown victim (establishes tone)

SCENE LAYOUT:

1. ENTERING THE ROOM
   - Victim enters cautiously through doorway
   - White cube room, appears empty
   - No obvious danger
   - Steps forward into center of room

2. TRAP ACTIVATION
   - As victim reaches center, trap activates
   - No sound, no warning
   - Victim freezes, realizes something is wrong
   - Looks down at hands

3. DIMENSIONAL DISSOLUTION BEGINS
   - Fingertips begin dissolving
   - Simultaneously reappearing to his right side
   - Not painful at first - just strange
   - Victim scared but doesn't scream
   - Tries to understand what's happening

4. ESCALATION
   - Effect spreads to all extremities
   - Fingers, toes, hands, feet
   - Dissolving and reappearing impossibly far apart
   - Body parts separated by space that shouldn't exist
   - Victim's expression: horror, confusion, acceptance

5. FINAL MOMENTS
   - Dissolution accelerates
   - Entire body being torn apart "dimensionally"
   - Not violent - almost peaceful in its horror
   - Parts of him existing in multiple places at once
   - Victim still conscious throughout

6. COMPLETE
   - 20 seconds total from activation to death
   - Victim torn apart across dimensional space
   - Room returns to normal appearance
   - Empty, waiting for next victim

TONE: Quiet horror, establishes cube's alien nature, death without violence
CHARACTER DYNAMICS: Victim alone, helpless against incomprehensible force
KEY TENSION: Unknown, unstoppable, beyond human understanding

================================================================================

Description:
Cold open. Unknown victim enters white cube room cautiously. Steps into center. Trap activates silently. Fingertips begin
dissolving and reappearing to his right - dimensional transporter malfunction. He's scared but doesn't scream. Effect
spreads to all extremities - fingers, toes, hands, feet dissolving and reappearing impossibly far apart. Continues for 20
seconds. Victim torn apart "dimensionally" - body parts existing in multiple impossible locations simultaneously.
Conscious throughout. Not violent, almost peaceful in its alien horror. Room returns to normal, empty. Establishes cube's
incomprehensible nature and guaranteed lethality.

Key Elements:
- Dimensional transporter trap (unique to cube physics)
- Silent activation - no warning
- Dissolution and reassembly in wrong locations
- Body parts impossibly separated in space
- Victim conscious throughout 20-second death
- Scared but doesn't scream - too strange to process
- Establishes cube's alien, beyond-human-comprehension nature
- Sets tone: quiet horror, inevitable death

Establishes:
- Cube is deadly and alien
- Deaths are not always violent - sometimes incomprehensible
- No safety, no warning
- Dimensional physics are weaponized
- Tone for entire film

FADE IN:

INT. ROOT CUBE - TRAP ROOM - UNKNOWN TIME

Darkness.

White walls fade into view. A CUBE ROOM - sterile, identical surfaces on all sides.

A MAN (30s, business casual, INZO employee badge) crawls through a doorway. Breathing hard. Frightened but controlled.

He stands carefully. Scans the room.

Empty. No visible threats.

He steps forward cautiously. One step. Another.

Reaches the CENTER of the room.

Stops.

Something's wrong. He feels it.

Looks down at his hands.

His FINGERTIPS are DISSOLVING - pixels breaking apart in slow motion.

Simultaneously, they REAPPEAR six feet to his right.

His fingers exist in two places at once - dissolving on his hands, manifesting in empty air.

The man's eyes widen. Fear, but quiet. Too strange to scream.

He tries to move his fingers. Both sets respond. The dissolved ones flicker.

The effect SPREADS.

Both hands now. Toes. Feet. Dissolving from his body, reappearing impossibly far away.

He looks at his RIGHT HAND - half-dissolved, flickering.

Looks to his RIGHT - sees his hand floating in space, ten feet away, fully formed.

His left foot dissolves. Reappears behind him.

He's being TORN APART across dimensional space.

Not violent. Not bloody. Just... wrong.

His expression: horror, confusion, a terrible understanding.

He tries to speak. His jaw dissolves. Reappears above his head.

20 SECONDS since activation.

Pieces of him exist in a dozen impossible locations.

Fingers here. Forearm there. Foot across the room. Torso splitting.

Then -

COMPLETE DISSOLUTION.

He's gone.

The room is EMPTY again.

White walls. Silent. Waiting.
