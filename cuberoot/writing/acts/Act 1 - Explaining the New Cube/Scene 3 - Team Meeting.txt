                    SCREENPLAY
          ========================================

EXT. INZO FACILITY - WALKWAY BETWEEN BUILDINGS - DAY

The Food Experimentation team exits their building and walks across an exterior courtyard/walkway. ALEX (30s, practical
scientist) carries coffee and a backpack. MORRIS (40s, disheveled but thoughtful) adjusts his glasses. DARIUS (neat,
precise movements) and SOFIA (late 30s, pragmatic) walk alongside them. All wear Food Experimentation badges.

Ahead of them: the QUANTUM LOGISTICS BUILDING - a distinct, cube-like structure that looks more secure and modern than
their own building.

                    SOFIA
          Imagine liking cubes so much you work in one.

                    MORRIS
          Do you know what this is about?

                    ALEX
          Just says "team integration meeting."

                    SOFIA
          That's never good.

                    DARIUS
          Maybe they're finally giving us a raise.

Morris gestures while thinking.

                    MORRIS
          Well, technically, cross-departmental
          integration usually means... I mean,
          it could be budget reallocation, or—

                    DARIUS
          Ackchually, a raise is budget reallocation.

Morris stops talking. Alex smiles to herself.

They reach the entrance to the Quantum Logistics building.


INT. QUANTUM LOGISTICS BUILDING - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

The Food team enters. The interior feels different - more secure, more sterile, more high-tech than their familiar
workspace. They navigate through hallways.

They approach a conference room. Through the glass, they can see people already seated inside.


INT. QUANTUM LOGISTICS BUILDING - CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

The Food Team enters. The QUANTUM TEAM is already seated around the table: LEA (dimensional physicist, serious), NINA
(youngest, mathematician), RASHID, CHEN (practical engineer), and YUKI.

MARCUS (late 30s, focused leader) stands near the front, arms crossed. EDGAR (corporate VP, polished) sits off to the
side with a tablet.

The room falls quiet.

                    MARCUS
          Ah, perfect timing. Come in, please.
          Find a seat.

Marcus gestures welcomingly - professional but with a subtle boss demeanor. The food team files in, taking seats across
from the quantum team.

Alex sets her coffee down carefully. Lea gives her a small, knowing look.

                    MARCUS (CONT'D)
          Thanks for coming. I know this was
          short notice. Let's start with
          introductions - put some names to faces.

He nods to the food team.

                    MARCUS (CONT'D)
          Food Experimentation meet Quantum
          Logistics. The company's greatest teams
          together. I'm Marcus, head of QL. We've
          implemented a lot of the n=0 stuff
          you've seen, but higher ups...

Alex glances toward Edgar.

                    MARCUS (CONT'D)
          ...think we can synergize on your
          dimensional expertise. Alex, can you
          take us through your team?

Alex sits up straighter.

                    ALEX
          I'm Alex, team lead. We're the Food
          Experimentation team - we've been working
          on molecular compression and storage
          solutions. Most recently, sof-tak - the
          everything food.

She gestures to each team member in turn.

                    ALEX (CONT'D)
          This is Morris, Darius, and Sofia.

                    MORRIS
          I've been working on the molecular
          bonding side of sof-tak - well,
          technically we all contributed, but my
          focus was more on preventing structural
          degradation during... does that matter?

                    ALEX
          (gently)
          Morris is fine.

                    MORRIS
          Right. Morris.

Darius gives a brief nod.

                    DARIUS
          Darius.

Sofia nods as well.

                    SOFIA
          Sofia.

Marcus nods, then gestures to his team.

                    MARCUS
          Quantum Logistics. Lea - dimensional
          physics.

Lea nods professionally. She makes brief eye contact with Alex - a moment of recognition between old friends.

                    MARCUS (CONT'D)
          Nina - mathematician.

Nina, noticeably the youngest in the room, gives a slight smile.

                    MARCUS (CONT'D)
          Rashid - math, Yuki  - math, and Chen -
          engineering.

The three nod in turn.

Marcus begins to continue, but Edgar stands, doing a small synergy hand gesture.

                    EDGAR
          Edgar - VP of Logistics. Just here to
          show some leadership support. Excited
          about the synergy potential here.

He sits back down.

Awkward beat.

                    MARCUS
          Right. So. Before we get into specifics,
          I need everyone to sign a confidentiality
          agreement. Standard procedure for this
          level of work.

He slides a stack of papers down the table to the Food team.

                    MARCUS (CONT'D)
          The short version - what we discuss here
          stays here. Company property, trade
          secrets, et cetera.

People start signing. Alex signs quickly, pen still in hand.

                    ALEX
          What do you mean integration?

Edgar holds up a hand, waiting. The room goes quiet as people finish signing. Morris is the last, reading carefully. He
signs.

Edgar stands.

                    EDGAR
          Sof-tak has hit profit maximization.
          Congratulations - you did your jobs
          too well. The dollarinos are maxed out.
          And as of now...

He pauses for effect.

                    EDGAR (CONT'D)
          ...Food Experimentation for sof-tak
          doesn't exist. You don't have a choice
          here.

The food team sits in shocked silence. Sofia's face hardens. Darius's jaw tightens. Morris looks between his teammates,
uncertain.

Edgar gestures to Marcus to continue.

Marcus pulls up a slideshow on the screen. The first slide shows a rotating 4-D TESSERACT - a hypercube.

                    MARCUS
          Quick background. INZO's been working
          with dimensional storage for the better
          part of a decade. Started with n=4
          hypercubes for prisoner containment.

Alex stares at the tesseract on screen. Nina shifts slightly - something about this bothers her, but she stays quiet.

                    MARCUS (CONT'D)
          It was a scientific...

He gestures to Nina while continuing - indicating a previous conversation.

                    MARCUS (CONT'D)
          ...and a mathematical breakthrough, but
          not profitable.

He clicks to the next slide - simpler cube illustrations showing the dimensional progression.

                    MARCUS (CONT'D)
          The hypercube paradox - we tried to
          create MORE space, which worked, but
          cost more. Then we figured out LESS
          space saves money. Much more efficient.
          N=0 became the focus.

                    DARIUS
          Wait, n=0? That's—

                    MARCUS
          A point. Zero-space. Totally sizeless.

Beat. The food team exchanges glances. Nina leans forward slightly, interested.

                    MARCUS (CONT'D)
          There are... caveats. But that's why
          you're here.

                    DARIUS
          What kind of caveats? Is there a problem?

                    NINA
          We'll go through safety protocol with each
          of you so no one—

Marcus opens his mouth, but Edgar stands, cutting Nina off.

                    EDGAR
          We'll get to all of that. First, let's
          make sure everyone's settled in. This is
          going to be a long briefing.

                    SOFIA
          What do you mean safety?

Edgar checks his watch.

                    EDGAR (CONT'D)
          Actually, why don't we break? Stretch
          your legs, check your access. Alex and
          Lea, do you need a few?

                    LEA
          Yes sir, need to fill the coffee for
          this part.

People start to stand. Lea catches Alex's eye and gestures toward the door - an invitation between old friends.

                    ALEX
          Did you know about this?

                    LEA
          A couple seconds before you. Coffee?

                    ALEX
          Yeah. Definitely.

They head for the exit together.

Behind them, Nina, Rashid, and Yuki immediately fall into rapid conversation - the fast-talking mathematician trio.
Morris pulls a small sof-tak ball from his pocket and offers it to Chen as they walk.

                    MORRIS
          Sof-tak?

Chen takes it with an appreciative nod. The group breaks into small conversations as they walk to the lab area.

FADE OUT.
