FULL SCRIPT
========================================

INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Alex and Lea step out of the conference room. The door closes behind them, muffling the voices of the others inside. They start walking down the hallway.

Alex glances at Lea, studying her friend's face.

ALEX
So. That was... a lot.

LEA
Yeah.

They walk in silence for a moment.

ALEX
I have questions.

LEA
I know you do.

Lea looks at Alex. A weight is visible in her expression.

LEA
Can we... catch up first? Before we get into all the work stuff?

Alex nods, understanding.

ALEX
Of course.

INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

They walk toward the coffee area. The hallway is sterile, corporate. Lea's shoulders carry visible tension.

LEA
So... how long has it been? Three years?

ALEX
Four. Since graduation.

LEA
Right. God. Four years.

They walk a few more steps.

LEA
I heard you stayed with the bread-meat project the whole time. Made it actually work.

ALEX
Sof-tak. Yeah. Turns out making food that tastes good is harder than making food that lasts forever.

Lea manages a genuine smile at that.

LEA
That sounds about right.

They turn a corner. The moment of levity passes. Lea's expression shifts. The weight returns.

ALEX
What about you? When did you transfer to Quantum Logistics?

Lea's smile fades completely.

LEA
Two years ago. Right when Marcus took over the division.

She glances at Alex, then away.

LEA
A lot will be explained. In the briefing, I mean. Marcus has slides and everything.

She attempts another small smile. It doesn't reach her eyes.

ALEX
Lea, what's going on?

Lea's professional mask slips slightly.

LEA
The most important thing is your safety... I couldn't stand losing more people.

Alex stops walking. Lea stops too.

ALEX
More people?

LEA
The company won't put safety first. They won't. And I need you to know that going in.

ALEX
I'm not planning on losing anyone.

Alex speaks firmly.

LEA
Neither am I. We know the people in there aren't dead.

Lea speaks equally firm, but trails into uncertainty.

Alex absorbs this, trusting Lea's assessment. If Lea says the company won't prioritize safety, Alex believes her.

ALEX
Are employees in the cube? The zero-space thing Marcus mentioned?

Lea looks away, composing herself. When she looks back, her eyes are slightly wet.

LEA
Not exactly... not intentionally.

Her voice cracks slightly on the last word. She takes a breath, steadying herself.

LEA
We were pushing the bounds of science. That's what it was supposed to be. Understanding dimensional physics, solving impossible problems.

She starts walking again. Alex follows, listening.

LEA
We weren't trying to hurt people. We were trying to understand. But then Marcus... he pushed for profit. Making it work for the company. And everything changed.

They reach a small coffee station. Lea's hands shake slightly as she reaches for a cup. Alex notices.

ALEX
Lea. Hey.

Alex touches Lea's arm gently. Lea stops, looks at her friend.

ALEX
Take a breath. Talk to me.

Lea sets the cup down, not trusting her hands. She looks at Alex. Relief and desperation mix in her expression.

LEA
I'm glad you're here. I know the integration doesn't make sense. Food science and dimensional physics, it's not... but I need your help.

ALEX
With what?

LEA
Edgar is coming down. Did you see him in there? He's going to push Marcus to push us. And if someone makes a mistake...

She trails off. The implications hang in the air.

LEA
It could get worse.

Alex absorbs this. Her practical mind is already working through the implications.

ALEX
How much worse?

Lea meets her eyes.

LEA
I don't know. That's what scares me.

The weight of what's unsaid settles between them.

ALEX
We should get the coffee. Before they wonder where we went.

Lea nods, grateful for the practical redirect. She picks up the cup again, more steady now. They start making coffee in silence.

Lea glances at Alex. Something unspoken weighs on her mind. A memory from college. A protest. Words about silence and complicity. But she doesn't bring it up. Some things are better left unsaid.

LEA
The sof-tak you mentioned. In the meeting.

ALEX
Yeah?

LEA
Could someone... could someone live off it? Forever?

Alex considers this, pouring coffee.

ALEX
Theoretically? The nutrient density is there. But you know what they say - if it tastes good, it'll kill you.

She hands Lea a cup with a slight smile.

ALEX
So sof-tak will make you live double forever.

Lea manages a genuine laugh at that. They start walking back toward the conference room.

As they approach the door, Lea stops suddenly.

LEA
Alex. Your lab supplies. From Food Experimentation.

ALEX
What about them?

LEA
Transfer everything to Quantum Logistics. All of it. Before someone else takes it.

Alex sees the urgency in Lea's eyes.

ALEX
Okay. I will.

Lea nods. She reaches for the conference room door handle.

CUT TO:

A cube door opens somewhere in the n=3 structure.

FADE OUT.
