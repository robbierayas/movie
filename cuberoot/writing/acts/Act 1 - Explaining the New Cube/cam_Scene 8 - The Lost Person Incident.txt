SCENE 8 - THE LOST PERSON INCIDENT
==================================

INT. QUANTUM LOGISTICS BUILDING - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Marcus and Edgar exit the secure briefing room. Lea and Alex follow a few steps behind. The four walk down the hallway toward the lab.

Edgar checks his tablet, oblivious to the tension.

                    EDGAR
          Great session. Really getting that
          synergy flowing.

Marcus doesn't respond. Lea glances at Alex - a look that says "this is what I meant."


INT. QUANTUM LOGISTICS BUILDING - LAB AREA - CONTINUOUS

The lab is bustling. The rest of the team (Morris, Darius, Sofia, Nina, Rashid, Chen, Yuki) are gathered around examining equipment from Scene 6.

DELIVERY PERSONNEL are wheeling in boxes and equipment - Alex's old Food Experimentation supplies.

A CLIPBOARD is thrust toward Alex by a delivery person.

                    DELIVERY PERSON
          Sign here.

Alex takes the clipboard. Morris holds up the piece of sof-tak skin with "WE'RE ALL DYING" scratched into it.

Morris's hands shake slightly. His voice stammers.

                    MORRIS
          So, um... this is probably... I mean,
          it came back through the transmitter
          and it's definitely concerning. The
          message, I mean. Not the sof-tak
          itself. Well, both are concerning,
          but—

Darius steps closer to Morris.

                    DARIUS
          What does the message mean?

Sofia and Morris both look to Marcus and Edgar as they enter.

                    SOFIA
          Who wrote this?

Lea steps forward, composing herself. Her jaw sets.

                    LEA
          We're here to explain. Everyone,
          please. Sit.

The team exchanges glances. They begin settling into chairs and workspace stools around the lab. Chen takes a seat between Yuki and Rashid. Alex finishes signing the delivery form, hands the clipboard back, and is given the sof-tak skin.

Alex examines it silently. The scratched letters are crude but desperate. Her expression hardens.

Lea waits until everyone is seated. The delivery personnel exit. The door closes.

Silence.

Marcus leans against a workbench, arms crossed. Edgar stands to the side, tablet in hand, watching like this is a normal business meeting.

                    MARCUS
          Before we go further, you need to
          understand what happened. The full
          picture.

Beat.

                    MARCUS (CONT'D)
          Fourteen days ago, one of our team
          members got sucked into root-space
          while running an experiment.

Morris shifts uncomfortably in his seat. Darius leans forward.

                    MARCUS (CONT'D)
          His name is Barry. Dimensional
          physicist. Instrumentation specialist.

Chen's jaw tightens - Barry was his close colleague.

                    DARIUS
          You kept going? After losing someone?

Lea's hands tighten in her lap.

                    LEA
          We didn't shut down. We... we kept
          working.

Her voice is strained. Alex notices but doesn't interrupt.

                    MARCUS
          We know he's safe. Just trapped.

                    ALEX
          You know he's safe?

                    MARCUS
          Yes.

                    ALEX
          In the death cube?

                    LEA
          Barry's smart. He jerryrigged the
          device to send things back through.
          That's how we discovered we could
          communicate with him.

Marcus gestures to the sof-tak skin Alex is holding.

                    MARCUS
          That message came from Barry. But
          there's no telling how long his
          device will last.

Alex's voice drops to near-whisper.

                    ALEX
          You can't talk to him?

                    LEA
          No. Only... only one-way communication.
          He can send things back. We can't
          send messages in. Just objects.

Sofia processes this, her face darkening with the implications.

                    MORRIS
          Wait, so when Chen sent the sof-tak
          through earlier... Barry must have...
          he was just right there?

Chen nods slightly, pain visible in his expression.

Yuki's voice is matter-of-fact, clinical.

                    YUKI
          "Just right there" might not mean the
          same in zero space-time, but yeah.

Alex's eyes flash to Edgar, then to Marcus. Marcus meets her gaze but says nothing.

Beat.

                    DARIUS
          You said one person. The message says
          "we're all dying." Plural.

Lea's composure cracks slightly. She looks down.

Marcus takes over.

                    MARCUS
          Twelve days ago, a second incident.
          Josh. Theoretical physicist, math
          focus.

Lea's breath catches - barely noticeable, but Alex hears it.

                    MARCUS (CONT'D)
          He wasn't careful enough during an
          experiment. Got sucked in.

Lea's breath catches - barely noticeable, but Alex hears it.

                    LEA
               (voice tight)
                    Barry was trapped... IS trapped and Josh was doing everything to save him. I hope they're together,
          but we can't know.

Her hands are shaking. She grips them together to steady herself.

                    MARCUS
          After Josh, we implemented safety
          protocols. Too late for them, but—

Alex cuts him off, her focus on Lea.

                    ALEX
          They were the experts.

It's not a question.

                    ALEX (CONT'D)
          You wouldn't have let them work alone
          if you didn't trust them.

Lea meets Alex's eyes. A long beat. She nods once.

                    LEA
          Barry worked with Chen on all the
          instrumentation. They were... close
          colleagues.

Chen stares at the floor.

                    LEA (CONT'D)
          Josh was... he's—

Her voice cracks. She can't finish.

Edgar, oblivious, interjects with inappropriate cheer.

                    EDGAR
          This is why we brought you folks in.
          Fresh perspectives. Sometimes you
          need new eyes on a problem, you know?

Sofia stares at Edgar, disbelief plain on her face. Morris looks horrified. Alex's expression is unreadable.

                    SOFIA
          You're talking about people trapped
          in another dimension like it's a
          staffing issue.

Edgar's brow furrows, genuinely confused.

                    EDGAR
          It is. When the best on the team went
          missing, I brought in the best in the
          company. Is there someone else you
          know who would be an expert on unknown
          technology?

Alex cuts through the tension, redirecting to Marcus.

                    ALEX
          What's the strange detail?

Marcus shifts his weight.

                    MARCUS
          The communications from inside...
          they don't always seem to be from
          the same person.

                    DARIUS
          What does that mean?

                    MARCUS
          We don't know. The handwriting
          changes. The phrasing. Sometimes it
          sounds like Barry. Sometimes it
          doesn't.

                    LEA
          Something's happening to them in
          there. To their... consciousness.

                    YUKI
          Well, their atoms.

                    RASHID
          No, the atoms collisions, right?

Chen interrupts before the technical debate spirals.

                    CHEN
          We don't understand it fully.

The weight of this settles over the room. Yuki leans behind Chen's back to tap Rashid's shoulder, getting his attention. Her whisper is barely audible.

                    YUKI
          That's if it's not subatomic.

Nina has been silent, observing. She leans forward now.

                    NINA
          Lea, there's something else.

Lea looks up.

                    NINA (CONT'D)
          We have new data. Analysis from the
          last forty-eight hours. You and
          Marcus haven't seen it yet.

                    MARCUS
          What kind of data?

Nina glances at Rashid and Yuki. They exchange a look - they know what she's about to say.

                    NINA
          The kind that changes everything.

The team gathers around as Nina pulls up her analysis. Alex still holds the sof-tak skin, the desperate message carved into it.

"WE'RE ALL DYING."
