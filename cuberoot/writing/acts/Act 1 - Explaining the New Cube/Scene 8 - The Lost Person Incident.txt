- ALEX - Food scientist, protagonist
- LEA - Dimensional expert
- MORRIS - Food scientist, comic relief
- DARIUS - Food scientist
- SOFIA - Food scientist

CHARACTERS TRAPPED IN N=0.333 (discussed):
- BARRY - Dimensional physicist, instrumentation specialist, bearded (sucked in first)
- JOSH - Theoretical physicist, math focus, 30s (sucked in second, had feelings for Lea)

SCENE LAYOUT:

1. RETURNING FROM SCENE 7
   - Marcus and Edgar leave the secure briefing room
   - Head back to the main lab area
   - Alex and Lea follow
   - Rest of team still there from Scene 6

2. SUPPLIES DELIVERY ARRIVAL
   - Delivery personnel wheeling in boxes and equipment
   - Alex's old Food Experimentation lab supplies
   - Transferred per Lea's earlier advice (Scene 4)
   - Equipment, materials, tools being unloaded
   - Morris holds up the sof-tak skin with "WE'RE ALL DYING" scratched into it
   - Morris and Darius ask what the message means and who wrote it
   - Lea says they are here to explain and asks everyone to sit
   - Alex finishes signing delivery form and is handed the skin
   - Alex silently examines it

3. MARCUS AND LEA EXPLAIN TO FOOD TEAM - BARRY
   - Marcus begins explanation for newcomers
   - First incident: Barry got sucked into n=0.333 while experimenting
   - He was holding a device when it happened
   - Barry's a dimensional physicist with instrumentation focus
   - Worked closely with Chen on equipment
   - Team didn't shut down - they kept going
   - Barry jerryrigged the device to send things back,no telling how long it lasts
   - Discovered they could communicate with him this way, they can't talk to him

4. THE SECOND INCIDENT - JOSH
   - Josh, theoretical physicist, also got sucked in
   - Wasn't careful enough during an experiment
   - Josh got sucked in trying to help Barry
   - After that incident, they've been much more careful
   - Safety protocols implemented (too late)
   - Lea's emotional reaction (Josh and she had unspoken feelings)

5. THE STRANGE DETAIL
   - Communications from inside don't always seem to be from same person
   - Something odd about identity or consciousness in fractional dimension
   - Team exchanges uneasy glances

6. NINA'S INTERJECTION
   - Nina speaks up: the QL team has new data analysis
   - Lea and the managers haven't seen it yet
   - They haven't had time to share findings with higher-ups
   - Data points to something critical (singularity)
   - Sets up Scene 9 presentation
   - Tense atmosphere - ethical questions unspoken

TONE: Tense revelation, ethical discomfort, setting up technical analysis
DYNAMICS: QL team revealing their dark secret to Food team, Nina has critical findings to share
KEY TENSION: The team kept experimenting with people trapped inside. What does that say about them? What's happening to
consciousness in n=0.333? What does the new data show?

========================================
CONDENSED DESCRIPTION:
========================================

Marcus, Edgar, Alex, and Lea return from the secure briefing room to the main lab where the rest of the team is examining
the sof-tak skin with "WE'RE ALL DYING" scratched into it. As Alex's food lab supplies are delivered, the team demands
answers. Marcus and Lea reveal the full truth: fourteen days ago, Barry (a dimensional physicist and instrumentation
specialist) was sucked into the n=0.333 dimension during an experiment. The team didn't shut down - they kept working.
Barry jerryrigged his device to send objects back, enabling one-way communication. Twelve days ago, Josh (a theoretical
physicist) was also sucked in trying to help Barry. The communications from inside don't always seem to be from the same
person - suggesting something is happening to consciousness in the fractional dimension. Edgar reveals his obliviousness,
treating the trapped people as a "staffing issue." Nina announces the quantum team has new data analysis that changes
everything, setting up the next scene.

                    SCREENPLAY
          ========================================

INT. QUANTUM LOGISTICS BUILDING - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Marcus and Edgar exit the secure briefing room. Lea and Alex follow a few steps behind. The four walk down the hallway
toward the lab.

Edgar checks his tablet, oblivious to the tension.

                    EDGAR
          Great session. Really getting good
          vibes about the progress.

Marcus doesn't respond. Lea glances at Alex - a look that says "this is what I meant."


INT. QUANTUM LOGISTICS BUILDING - LAB AREA - CONTINUOUS

The lab is bustling. The rest of the team (Morris, Darius, Sofia, Nina, Rashid, Chen, Yuki) are gathered around examining
equipment from Scene 6.

DELIVERY PERSONNEL are wheeling in boxes and equipment - Alex's old Food Experimentation supplies.

A CLIPBOARD is thrust toward Alex by a delivery person.

                    DELIVERY PERSON
          Sign here.

Alex takes the clipboard. As she does, Morris holds up the piece of sof-tak skin with "WE'RE ALL DYING" scratched into
it.

                    MORRIS
          So, um... this is... I mean,
          it came back from root-space
          and it's definitely concerning. The
          message, I mean. Not the sof-tak
          itself. Well—

                    DARIUS
               (cutting in)
          Alex, what are we doing here?

Sofia and Morris both look to Marcus and Edgar as they enter.

                    SOFIA
          Who wrote this?

Lea steps forward, composing herself.

                    LEA
          We're here to explain. Everyone,
          please. Sit.

The team exchanges glances. They begin settling into chairs and workspace stools around the lab. Chen is sitting between
 Yuri and Rashid. Alex finishes signing the delivery form, hands the clipboard back, and is given the sof-tak skin.

Alex examines it silently. The scratched letters are crude but desperate. Her expression hardens.

Lea waits until everyone is seated. The delivery personnel exit. The door closes.

Silence.

Marcus leans against a workbench, arms crossed. Edgar stands to the side, tablet in hand, watching like this is a normal
business meeting.

                    MARCUS
          Before we go further, you need to
          understand what happened. The full
          picture.

Beat.

                    MARCUS (CONT'D)
          Fourteen days ago, one of our team
          members got sucked into root-space
          while running an experiment.

Morris shifts uncomfortably. Darius leans forward.

                    MARCUS (CONT'D)
          His name is Barry. Dimensional
          physicist. Instrumentation specialist.

Chen's jaw tightens - Barry was his close colleague.

                    DARIUS
          You kept going? After losing someone?

Lea's hands tighten in her lap.

                    LEA
          We didn't shut down. We... we kept
          working.

Her voice is strained. Alex notices but doesn't interrupt.

                    MARCUS
          We know he's safe. Just trapped.

                    ALEX
          You know he's safe?

                    MARCUS
          Yes.

                    ALEX
          In the death cube?

                    LEA
          Barry's smart. He jerryrigged the
          device to send data back through.
          That's how we have been getting closer
          to getting them out.

Marcus gestures to the sof-tak skin Alex is holding.

                    MARCUS
          That message must have come from Barry, and shows you how we are getting there. But
          there's no telling how long his
          device will last. So we have to hurry.

                    ALEX
               (quietly)
          You can't talk to him?

                    LEA
          No. Only... only one-way communication.We can send objects, messages in.
          He can only send data back.

Sofia processes this, disturbed.

Alex's eyes flash to Edgar, then to Marcus. Marcus meets her gaze but says nothing.

Beat.

                    DARIUS
          You said one person. The message says
          "we're all dying." Plural.

Lea's composure cracks slightly. She looks down.

Marcus takes over.

                    MARCUS
          Twelve days ago, a second incident.
          Josh. Theoretical physicist, math
          focus.

Lea's breath catches - barely noticeable, but Alex hears it.

                    MARCUS (CONT'D)
          He wasn't careful enough during an
          experiment. Got sucked in.

                    LEA
               (voice tight)
                    Barry was trapped... IS trapped and Josh was doing everything to save him. I hope they're together,
          but we can't know.

Her hands are shaking. She grips them together to steady herself.

                    MARCUS
          After Josh, we implemented safety
          protocols. Too late for them, but—

                    ALEX
               (interrupting, to Lea)
          They were the experts.

It's not a question.

                    ALEX (CONT'D)
          You wouldn't have let them work alone
          if you didn't trust them.

Lea meets Alex's eyes. A long beat. She nods once.

                    LEA
          Barry worked with Chen on all the
          instrumentation. They were... close
          colleagues.

Chen stares at the floor.

                    LEA (CONT'D)
          Josh was... he's—

She can't finish. Her voice cracks.

Edgar, oblivious, interjects cheerfully.

                    EDGAR
          This is why we brought you folks in.
          Shorter rotations. Buddy system. And sometimes you just
          need new eyes on a problem, you know?

Sofia stares at Edgar, disbelieving. Morris looks horrified. Alex's expression is unreadable.

                    SOFIA
          You're talking about people trapped
          in another dimension like it's a
          staffing issue.

                    EDGAR
               (genuinely confused)
          It is. When the best on the team went
          missing, I brought in the best in the
          company. Is there someone else you
          know who would be an expert on unknown
          technology?

                    ALEX
               (cutting him off, to Marcus)
          What's the message mean?

Marcus shifts.

                    MARCUS
          Barry... or Josh has scratched these in items sent back...
          This doesn't seem to be from
          the same person.

                    DARIUS
          What does that mean?

                    MARCUS
          I don't know. It doesn't sound like Barry. His handwriting... he always made a point...

                    LEA
          Something's happening to them in
          there. The harmonics are warping their... consciousness.

                    YUKI
          Well, their atoms.

                    RASHID
          No, the atoms collisions, right?

                    CHEN
               (interrupting)
          We don't understand it fully.

The weight of this settles over the room. Yuki leans behind Chen's back to tap Rashid to get his attention.

                    YUKI
               (whispering)
          That's if it's not subatomic.

Nina has been silent, observing. She leans forward now.

                    NINA
          Lea, there's something else.

Lea looks up.

                    NINA (CONT'D)
          We have new data. Analysis from the
          last forty-eight hours. You and
          Marcus haven't seen it yet.

                    MARCUS
          What kind of data?

Nina glances at Rashid and Yuki. They exchange a look - they know what she's about to say.

                    NINA
          The kind that changes everything.

The team gathers around as Nina pulls up her analysis. Alex still holds the sof-tak skin, the desperate message carved
into it.

"WE'RE ALL DYING."
