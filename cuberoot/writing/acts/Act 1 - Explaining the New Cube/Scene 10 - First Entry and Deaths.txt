    - Expedition supplies they prepared = survival supplies
    - Edgar discovered this when he went to get dinner
    - NOTE: Josh (trapped earlier) is NOT in the same room as Barry
    - Not shown: Josh is too scared to move, lost somewhere else in the dimension
    - Cliffhanger ending
    - Transition to Act 2

TONE: Quiet preparation building to shocking horror, dark humor masking terror
DYNAMICS: Team bonding before catastrophe, Marcus revealing corporate brutality
KEY TENSION: When did they get pulled in? Are they trapped forever? The supplies they prepared for "sending in" are now
all they have to survive.

VISUAL NOTES:
- Late night lighting - tired, focused work atmosphere
- Contrast between casual conversations and final reveal
- Exterior shot should be visually striking - building sitting in a cube room

CHARACTER NOTES:
- Barry (bearded, instrumentation physicist) - dead in microwave trap room
- Josh (30s, theoretical physicist) - trapped earlier, found Barry's body
- Josh is too scared to navigate after Barry's death, lost somewhere in dimension
- Josh and Lea had unspoken romantic feelings - adds emotional weight
- Barry is dead and Josh is alone when team arrives in cube

========================================
CONDENSED DESCRIPTION:
========================================

Late at night, the team works in the lab finalizing the expedition kit - compressed sof-tak, measurement devices, and
communication equipment. Edgar announces he's going to pick up dinner before they send the kit through. While he's gone,
the team has various conversations: Morris, Nina, Rashid, and Yuki discuss the exciting scientific possibilities despite
the danger; Alex and Lea have a more serious conversation about how their careers diverged from their college ideals;
Marcus privately tells Darius he's bringing him into his "inner circle" and cryptically reveals that after the crisis,
low performers will probably get the death penalty - exposing INZO's brutal corporate culture. Edgar returns much earlier
than expected and asks if they've sent the kit through yet. When they confirm they haven't, he tells everyone to come
with him. He leads the confused team to the lobby where they look out the windows to see impossible geometry - the
building is inside a massive cube room. They've been pulled into the n=0.333 dimension without realizing it. Alex notices
Sofia's purse on the floor (she left earlier and never returned). Edgar turns to the team: "Hope you don't mind sof-tak
for dinner." The realization hits - they're not preparing to SEND an expedition, they ARE the expedition. The supplies
they prepared are now their survival rations. End of Act 1.

                    SCREENPLAY
          ========================================

INT. QUANTUM LOGISTICS BUILDING - LAB AREA - NIGHT

Late night. The lab has the tired, focused energy of people working against the clock. Overhead lights cast harsh
shadows.

The expedition kit is laid out in a pile at the center of the tables and desks:
- Stacks of compressed sof-tak in small packages
- Measurement devices and dimensional sensors
- Communication equipment
- Everything organized, ready

Team members move around doing final checks. Alex, Darius and Morris are near the expedition kit shrinking down sof-tak.
Lea is sitting at a computer showing something to Marcus standing behind her.

Chen stands near the transmitter - at a safe distance - reviewing safety protocols on a tablet.
Nina, Yuki, and Rashid stand by the chalkboard.

Edgar approaches the expedition kit from the loading bay.

                    EDGAR
          Hey, folks. I know you're all doing important work, but I wanted to do a quick time check.

                    ALEX
          We're just about ready here.

Edgar does a fist pump.

                    EDGAR
          Okay! Care package complete!

He looks around at the assembled kit unsure what to focus on

                    CHEN(to Lea)
          We'll have to stay to see what data comes through.

Edgar deflates hearing this, then checks his watch.

                    EDGAR
          No problemo. I'll go pick up dinner for
          everyone, so none of you get distracted.

                    MARCUS
          Great idea. Thanks a lot, Edgar.

Edgar heads toward the exit.

                    EDGAR
          Don't start without me. Wouldn't wanna miss it!

Edgar exits. The door closes behind him.

                    MARCUS
          I hope he gets something good. I'm so hungry.

                    LEA
          There's sof-tak if...

                    MARCUS
          Anything but that.

The team continues working for a beat, then the energy shifts slightly - relief at the "boss" leaving the room.


NEAR THE SUPPLY BOXES - CONTINUOUS

Nina, Rashid, and Yuki near the chalkboard talking and discussing the board and equipment kit. Morris stands near them
partly understanding but not fully.

                    RASHID
          So if Barry can send us some data back,
          we can confirm the excitation threshold
          inside a fractional dimension... that's
          never been done. Ever.

                    YUKI
          The data will only apply to that dimension though.

                    RASHID
          If we CAN extrapolate, it would apply to all spatial dimensions.

                    NINA
          But it is still assuming time is passing normally.

Yuki and Rashid nod agreeing like it is obvious. Morris gestures enthusiastically, nearly knocking over a sensor.

                    MORRIS
          Masters of time and space!

Nina, Rashid, and Yuki laugh slightly.

                    MORRIS(CONT'D)
          I mean, yes, I was just listening and, the sof-tak we sent through would have lasted two weeks...

Nina, Rashid, and Yuki begin to lose smiles. Morris tries to recover.

                    MORRIS(CONT'D)
          But the care package has a hundred times that much, even if it's just that small bag. And what
          I was really getting at was we'll have a lot of data quickly and get them out of there...

Morris does air-quotes.

                    MORRIS(CONT'D)
          "sooner"

Nina smiles despite herself.

                    NINA
          You're not wrong.

                    YUKI
          I wonder if Barry can increase his upload rate.

                    RASHID
          With that homemade device? He's
          probably collecting more data than we
          could process.

Morris steps more toward the group. They share a moment of genuine scientific excitement - researchers fascinated by the
impossible, even in crisis.


LEA'S DESK - CONTINUOUS

Marcus walks to Chen. Alex takes the change to approach Lea at her desk for a quiet serious talk.

Lea stares at nothing, exhausted, absently holding a sof-tak ball. Lea speaks before Alex gets a chance to

                    LEA
          Do you remember what we told ourselves? Senior
          year?

Alex is taken slightly aback.

                    ALEX
          Party hardy til we're farty?

Lea ignoring the joke, rolling the ball on the desk in front of her.

                    LEA
          When I graduated...I wanted to do good work.
          Important work.

Beat.

                    LEA (CONT'D)
          And this? Quantum Logistics? I
          thought... I thought this was it. We were solving
          impossible problems. Making scientific
          breakthroughs.

                    ALEX
          You did.

                    LEA
          For profit. For prisons. For...

She throws the ball at the transmitter.

                    LEA (CONT'D)
          For this.

Alex waits a moment before responding.

                    ALEX
          I made sof-tak. Compressed food. I
          thought I was helping solve hunger.

                    LEA
          It's different. Sof-tak actually works.

                    ALEX
          It solved hunger...for millions of prisoners. INZO decided giving it to the
          public would make it too easy to copy. That's what matters to them.

They sit in silence.

                    LEA
          Is this what we wanted?

                    ALEX
          No.

                    LEA
          Is this what we deserved?

Alex looks at her friend - the weight Lea's carrying, the guilt, the grief for Josh.

                    ALEX
          No.

Lea nods. Swallows.

                    LEA
          We have to get them out. Barry.

Lea's voice cracks.

                    LEA
          Josh. We have to.

                    ALEX
          We will.

Lea wants to believe it.


BY THE TRANSMITTER - CONTINUOUS

Marcus stands with Darius, reviewing safety measurements. Marcus glances around, then pulls Darius slightly aside - more
private.

                    MARCUS
          So I saw your company record when you all got transferred. You're smart.

Darius looks uncertain where this is going.

                    MARCUS (CONT'D)
          I can tell you're not going to go off on your own. You're a team player, a company man. That's... that's
          valuable.

                    DARIUS
          Thank you?

Marcus leans in slightly.

                    MARCUS
          When we solve this - if we will solve
          this - INZO's going to evaluate
          everyone's performance.

                    DARIUS
          I understand.

                    MARCUS
          I don't think you do.

Beat. Marcus's voice drops.

                    MARCUS (CONT'D)
          Failed projects don't
          get severance packages. They become research subjects.

Darius stares at him.

                    MARCUS (CONT'D)
          Probably death penalty, realistically.

                    DARIUS
          You're joking.

Marcus holds his gaze.

                    MARCUS
          And new policy will have the same thing apply to low performers on successful projects.

                    MARCUS
          I'm bringing you into my inner circle.
          The people who perform well will be
          protected. I'll make sure they know you were a high performer. The ones who aren't team players...

He doesn't finish. Doesn't need to.

                    MARCUS (CONT'D)
          Just wanted you to understand the
          stakes.

Marcus walks away, leaving Darius standing there, processing the brutal reality of INZO's corporate culture.


MAIN LAB AREA - CONTINUOUS

The team continues working. Chen connects wiring. The quiet industry of late-night work.

Then the door opens.

Edgar enters slightly flustered - much earlier than twenty minutes.

The team looks up. Surprised.

                    CHEN
          That was fast.

Edgar's expression is odd. Tense. Focused.

                    EDGAR
          Did you send the kit through yet?

                    MARCUS
          No. We're still doing final checks.

                    EDGAR
          Good.

The word lands strangely. Everyone's attention is on him now. Edgar speaks loud enough for everyone to here.

                    EDGAR (CONT'D)
          I need everyone to come with me. Right
          now.

                    ALEX
          What's wrong?

                    EDGAR
          Just... come with me. Please.

The urgency in his voice is unmistakable. The team exchanges confused glances.


INT. QUANTUM LOGISTICS BUILDING - CONFERENCE HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

The team follows Edgar through the hallways. Their footsteps echo. The building feels different - quieter, emptier.

Morris walks near Nina.

                    MORRIS
               (whispered)
          Do you think something happened? I
          mean, obviously something happened,
          but what kind of something—

Nina shakes her head - she doesn't know either.

Alex and Lea exchange a look. Something's very wrong.

INT. QUANTUM LOGISTICS BUILDING - LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

The group approaches the front door. As they approach the door, Alex notices something on the floor outside the door - a
purse. Sofia's purse.

Edgar stops near the windows.

                    EDGAR
          Look.

The team moves to the windows. Then stops.

Through the glass, they see...

IMPOSSIBLE GEOMETRY.

Where there should be the parking lot, the courtyard, the other INZO buildings...

There are walls like a cube, but the pattern is different than they are used to. The building sits inside a massive cube
structure.

                    NINA
          That's not...

                    LEA
          That can't be...

Morris's face goes pale.

Chen steps closer to the window, transfixed and horrified.


EXTERIOR SHOT - THE REVEAL

The Quantum Logistics building sits in the center of an enormous cube room. The building takes up roughly 1/8 of the
space - small, isolated, trapped.

The walls of the cube emanate white light. This is n=0.333 space. The root cube.

No parking lot. No courtyard. No Earth.

Just the cubes.


                    BACK TO LOBBY

The team stands frozen at the windows. The realization spreading.

                    DARIUS
               (barely a whisper)
          When did this...

                    EDGAR
          Now I hope someone has an explanation for...

He can't finish.

                    MARCUS
          The root cube. It pulled us in.

                    NINA
          Because the building is a cube.

                    DARIUS
          We were preparing to send supplies in.

The pieces click into place for everyone.

Morris's eyes widen.

                    MORRIS
          We're not sending an expedition.

Alex turns to face them. Her expression is grim, resigned.

                    ALEX
          We are the expedition.

The words hang in the air.

Edgar steps forward, trying to maintain some control.

                    EDGAR
          I was gonna get dinner and... and this was already
          here. I was wanting to get something before it started...

His voice cracks slightly.

                    EDGAR (CONT'D)
          Hope you don't mind sof-tak for dinner.

The dark humor falls flat. No one laughs.

They stand in the lobby, staring out at their new reality.

Trapped.

The supplies they prepared for rescue are now their survival rations.

Somewhere in this impossible space, Barry and Josh are trapped. Suffering.

And now, so are they all.

FADE OUT.

END OF ACT 1
