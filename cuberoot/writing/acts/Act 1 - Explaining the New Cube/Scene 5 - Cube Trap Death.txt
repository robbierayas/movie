2. TRAP ACTIVATION
   - Barry reaches center of room
   - Subtle shift - temperature change, air shimmer

5. THE DEATH
   - 20 seconds total from activation

   - Barry's skin begins to redden
   - Breath coming in gasps
   - Water in cells boiling from inside
   - No screaming - too exhausted, too resigned

   - Gone

CHARACTER DYNAMICS: Lone survivor finally caught by cube
KEY TENSION: Even the smartest, most prepared can't survive forever

================================================================================

Description:
Barry alone, navigating cube room cautiously - clearly experienced survivor. Wearing business casual with cardigan
sweater (Josh will wear this sweater for rest of movie). Reaches center, trap activates. Barry WINCES but seems to KNOW
it would happen - resigned not surprised. Tries to run but door seals. Barry stops, turns, acceptance on face. Slumps
against door. Microwave trap kills him over 20 seconds - skin reddening, cellular cooking from inside. Slides down door,
dies without screaming. His notebook and destroyed quantameter nearby. Sets up Josh finding him later and taking notebook
and cardigan. Establishes: even prepared survivors die eventually.

Key Elements:
- Barry alone (or Josh watching from distance)
- Microwave/cellular disruption trap
- Barry knows trap would activate - resigned not surprised
- Tries to run but door seals
- Death over 20 seconds - quiet, inevitable
- No screaming - exhausted acceptance
- Notebook survives, quantameter destroyed
- Sets up Act 2 Scene 3 when Josh mentions Barry
- Establishes cube claims everyone eventually

Establishes:
- Barry was real person, survived in cube for time
- Built quantameter device to measure danger zones
- Device destroyed in trap, research notebook survives
- Even smart, prepared people die in cube
- Josh later finds body, takes notebook
- Foreshadows Josh's grief and Barry's notebook importance

FADE IN:

INT. ROOT CUBE - TRAP ROOM - DAY

BARRY (40s, bearded, exhausted) navigates the white cube room. Wearing business casual clothes with a CARDIGAN SWEATER -
now worn and disheveled from weeks in the cube.

Moves cautiously. Tests each step. Clearly experienced.

His backpack is worn. Face haggard. Been here for weeks.

He reaches the CENTER of the room.

A subtle SHIFT. Temperature change. Air shimmers.

BARRY WINCES.

He knew this would happen.

Not surprised. Just... resigned.

He RUNS toward the exit door.

Reaches it. Claws at the surface.

SEALED.

He pounds on it. Once. Twice.

Then stops.

Slowly turns around.

Looks at the room. The trap that will kill him.

His shoulders slump.

BARRY slides down against the door. Sits.

Quiet acceptance on his face.

The air shimmers more visibly now.

BARRY's skin begins to REDDEN. Microwave radiation at cellular level.

His breath comes in gasps.

Water in his cells boiling from inside out.

He closes his eyes.

20 SECONDS.

No screaming. Too exhausted. Too resigned.

He slumps to the side.

Gone.

The room is QUIET.

Barry's NOTEBOOK lies on the floor nearby. Pages scattered.

A destroyed DEVICE - the quantameter - smoking, melted.

The trap fades.

Room returns to normal.

Empty. Waiting for the next victim.

CAMERA PUSHES IN on Barry's body.

His INZO EMPLOYEE BADGE visible on his chest. The photo shows him younger, smiling, full of life.

CLOSE-UP: Barry's badge photo.

The image frozen in time. A reminder of who he was before the cube.

FADE OUT.
