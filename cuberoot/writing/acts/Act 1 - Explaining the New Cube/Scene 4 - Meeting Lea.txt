          ========================================

INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Alex and Lea step out of the conference room. The door closes behind them, muffling the voices of the others inside. They
start walking down the hallway.

Alex glances at Lea, studying her friend's face.

                    ALEX
          So. That was... a lot.

                    LEA
          Yeah.

Beat. They walk in silence for a moment.

                    ALEX
          I have questions.

                    LEA
          I know you do.

Lea looks at Alex - a weight visible in her expression.

                    LEA (CONT'D)
          Can we... catch up first? Before we
          get into all the work stuff?

Alex nods, understanding.

                    ALEX
          Of course.

INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

They walk toward the coffee area. The hallway is sterile, corporate. Lea's shoulders carry visible tension.

                    LEA
          So... how long has it been? Three years?

                    ALEX
          Four. Since graduation.

                    LEA
          Right. God. Four years.

Beat. They walk a few more steps.

                    LEA (CONT'D)
          I heard you stayed with the bread-meat
          project the whole time. Made it actually
          work.

                    ALEX
          Sof-tak. Yeah. Turns out making food
          that tastes good is harder than
          making food that lasts forever.

Lea manages a genuine smile at that.

                    LEA
          That sounds about right.

They turn a corner. The moment of levity passes. Lea's expression shifts - the weight returning.

                    ALEX
          What about you? When did you transfer
          to Quantum Logistics?

Lea's smile fades completely.

                    LEA
          Two years ago. Right when Marcus took
          over the division.

She glances at Alex, then away.

                    LEA (CONT'D)
          A lot will be explained. In the
          briefing, I mean. Marcus has slides
          and everything.

She attempts another small smile. It doesn't reach her eyes.

                    ALEX
          Lea, what's going on?

Lea's professional mask slips slightly.

                    LEA
          The most important thing is your safety...
          I couldn't stand losing more
          people.

Alex stops walking. Lea stops too.

                    ALEX
          More people?

                    LEA
          The company won't put safety first.
          They won't. And I need you to know
          that going in.

                    ALEX(firmly)
          I'm not planning on losing anyone.

                    LEA(equally firm, but trails into uncertainty)
          Neither am I. We know the people in there aren't dead.

Alex absorbs this, trusting Lea's assessment. If Lea says the company won't prioritize safety, Alex believes her.

                    ALEX
          Are employees in the cube? The zero-space
          thing Marcus mentioned?

Lea looks away, composing herself. When she looks back, her eyes are slightly wet.

                    LEA
          Not exactly... not intentionally.

Her voice cracks slightly on the last word. She takes a breath, steadying herself.

                    LEA (CONT'D)
          We were pushing the bounds of science.
          That's what it was supposed to be.
          Understanding dimensional physics,
          solving impossible problems.

She starts walking again. Alex follows, listening.

                    LEA (CONT'D)
          We weren't trying to hurt people. We
          were trying to understand. But then
          Marcus... he pushed for profit. Making
          it work for the company. And everything
          changed.

They reach a small coffee station. Lea's hands shake slightly as she reaches for a cup. Alex notices.

                    ALEX
          Lea. Hey.

Alex touches Lea's arm gently. Lea stops, looks at her friend.

                    ALEX (CONT'D)
          Take a breath. Talk to me.

Lea sets the cup down, not trusting her hands. She looks at Alex - relief and desperation mixed in her expression.

                    LEA
          I'm glad you're here. I know the
          integration doesn't make sense. Food
          science and dimensional physics, it's
          not... but I use your help.

                    ALEX
          With what?

                    LEA
          Edgar is coming down. Did you see him
          in there? He's going to push Marcus to push
          us. And if someone makes a mistake...

She trails off, the implications hanging in the air.

                    LEA (CONT'D)
          It could get worse.

Alex absorbs this. Her practical mind is already working through the implications.

                    ALEX
          How much worse?

Lea meets her eyes.

                    LEA
          I don't know. That's what scares me.

Beat. The weight of what's unsaid settles between them.

                    ALEX
          We should get the coffee. Before they
          wonder where we went.

Lea nods, grateful for the practical redirect. She picks up the cup again, more steady now. They start making coffee in
silence.

Lea glances at Alex, something unspoken weighing on her mind - a memory from college, a protest, words about silence and
complicity. But she doesn't bring it up. Some things are better left unsaid.

                    LEA
          The sof-tak you mentioned. In the
          meeting.

                    ALEX
          Yeah?

                    LEA
          Could someone... could someone live off
          it? Forever?

Alex considers this, pouring coffee.

                    ALEX
          Theoretically? The nutrient density is
          there. But you know what they say - if
          it tastes good, it'll kill you.

She hands Lea a cup, a slight smile.

                    ALEX (CONT'D)
          So sof-tak will make you live double
          forever.

Lea manages a genuine laugh at that. They start walking back toward the conference room.

As they approach the door, Lea stops suddenly.

                    LEA
          Alex. Your lab supplies. From Food
          Experimentation.

                    ALEX
          What about them?

                    LEA
          Transfer everything to Quantum Logistics.
          All of it. Before someone else takes it.

Alex sees the urgency in Lea's eyes.

                    ALEX
          Okay. I will.

Lea nods, then reaches for the conference room door handle.
