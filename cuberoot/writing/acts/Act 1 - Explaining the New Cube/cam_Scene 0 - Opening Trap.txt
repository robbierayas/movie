FADE IN:

INT. ROOT CUBE - TRAP ROOM - UNKNOWN TIME

Darkness.

White walls fade into view. A CUBE ROOM - sterile, identical surfaces on all sides.

A MAN (30s, business casual, INZO employee badge) crawls through a doorway. Breathing hard. Frightened but controlled.

He stands carefully. Scans the room.

Empty. No visible threats.

He steps forward cautiously. One step. Another.

Reaches the CENTER of the room.

Stops.

Something's wrong. He feels it.

Looks down at his hands.

His FINGERTIPS are DISSOLVING - pixels breaking apart in slow motion.

Simultaneously, they REAPPEAR six feet to his right.

His fingers exist in two places at once - dissolving on his hands, manifesting in empty air.

The man's eyes widen. Fear, but quiet. Too strange to scream.

He tries to move his fingers. Both sets respond. The dissolved ones flicker.

The effect SPREADS.

Both hands now. Toes. Feet. Dissolving from his body, reappearing impossibly far away.

He looks at his RIGHT HAND - half-dissolved, flickering.

Looks to his RIGHT - sees his hand floating in space, ten feet away, fully formed.

His left foot dissolves. Reappears behind him.

He's being TORN APART across dimensional space.

Not violent. Not bloody. Just... wrong.

His expression: horror, confusion, a terrible understanding.

He tries to speak. His jaw dissolves. Reappears above his head.

20 SECONDS since activation.

Pieces of him exist in a dozen impossible locations.

Fingers here. Forearm there. Foot across the room. Torso splitting.

Then -

COMPLETE DISSOLUTION.

He's gone.

The room is EMPTY again.

White walls. Silent. Waiting.
