SCENE LAYOUT:

1. NINA'S ANALYSIS PRESENTATION
   - Nina presents findings from latest data
   - The cube is acting like a singularity aka black hole
   - Actively sucking in other cubes regardless of dimensionality
   - n=0, n=3, n=4 cubes - all being pulled in

2. THE FRACTIONAL DIMENSION NATURE
   - Their experiments may have excited some quantum state
   - But this behavior is fundamental to fractional dimensions
   - n=0.333 can temporarily remain stable
   - But needs to periodically add mass to maintain itself
   - Like a hungry organism

3. FRACTAL TRIANGLE ILLUSTRATION
   - Nina illustrates with fractal triangle diagram
   - Shows how sides increase recursively
   - Visual representation of recursive growth pattern
   - The dimension is expanding, consuming

4. CHAOTIC CONVERSATION
   - Room erupts into panic, questions, theories
   - Multiple voices overlapping
   - Scientists trying to process implications
   - Fear mixing with scientific curiosity

5. EDGAR REALIZES THE SCOPE
   - Edgar asks clarification: effects outside the company?
   - Nina confirms: it's consuming other cubes, not contained to INZO property
   - Any cube structure anywhere - QL building and other INZO facilities at risk
   - Edgar's obliviousness drops - he's shaken
   - "How long have you known?" - acceleration started two days ago
   - Realizes he's been treating this like a staffing/budget issue
   - "How did we let it get this desperate?"
   - No one answers
   - Edgar steadies himself: "We need a plan"

6. THE EXPEDITION KIT PLAN
   - Edgar: treat Barry and Josh like astronauts
   - They can only help by staying alive and providing data from inside
   - Lea pushes to rescue them
   - Edgar: can't rescue yet, don't understand environment, would lose more people
   - Prepare expedition kit to send through: food, measurement equipment, communication devices
   - Send equipment in, NOT people
   - Alex volunteers: her food team can compress months of sof-tak into small package
   - Edgar agrees
   - Alex sends Morris and Darius to start pulling sof-tak and setting up compression equipment
   - Marcus: they have measurement tools, dimensional sensors, communication relays to pack
   - Edgar asks how long to assemble
   - Marcus: hours, if they work carefully

7. SAFETY PUSHBACK
   - Concern: someone else could get sucked in during prep
   - Lea and Alex both push back on the risk
   - Marcus, exasperated: doesn't have many options
   - Edgar offers: he'll stand closest to the kit if it makes them feel better
   - Lea and Alex back off for now
   - Tense compromise

8. THE COMPROMISE
   - Marcus: work in shifts, safety protocols in place, no one near transmitter without spotter
   - Nina notes it's almost 5pm
   - Edgar suggests late-night session: everyone goes home, gets what they need, comes back
   - Edgar suggests 8pm, Marcus says 9pm to give people time
   - Edgar agrees to 9pm
   - Edgar emphasizes: assemble kit properly with safety protocols
   - Importantly: NO ONE is going into the cube, just sending equipment
   - Marcus agrees

9. BREAKING TO PREPARE
   - Team starts to disperse to begin preparations
   - Sofia asks Alex if she can run home quick
   - Needs to deal with her kids before late-night session
   - Alex agrees

TONE: Scientific crisis, escalating tension, Edgar's shift from oblivious corporate to shaken realization, urgency vs.
safety
DYNAMICS: Nina as analyst revealing scope, Edgar dropping obliviousness and taking charge despite being shaken, Alex
finding practical contribution (food shrinking), Lea/Alex as safety advocates, Marcus exasperated by constraints
KEY TENSION: The dimension is consuming cube structures, not just at INZO but anywhere. The QL building could be next.
How do they stop it? Can they? Edgar finally understands the stakes. The kit they're preparing - will it really stay
unmanned?

========================================
CONDENSED DESCRIPTION:
========================================

Nina presents her analysis of the latest data: the n=0.333 cube is acting like a singularity, actively pulling in other
cubes regardless of dimensionality (n=0, n=3, n=4). The fractional dimension is fundamentally unstable - it can
temporarily remain stable but needs to periodically add mass to maintain itself, like a hungry organism. She illustrates
this with a fractal triangle showing recursive growth. The room erupts into chaotic panic and overlapping questions. When
Edgar asks if this affects things outside the company, Nina confirms it's consuming other cube structures - not just on
INZO property, but any building constructed with cube technology. The QL building and other facilities are at risk.
Edgar's corporate obliviousness drops completely as he realizes the scale of what they've mismanaged. He takes charge:
Barry and Josh are treated like astronauts providing data from inside, and the team will prepare an expedition kit (food,
measurement equipment, communication devices) to send through - not people. Alex offers that her food team can compress
months of sof-tak supplies. After pushback from Lea and Alex about safety risks, Edgar volunteers to stand closest to the
transmitter himself. The team agrees to a late-night session at 9pm to assemble the kit with proper safety protocols.
Sofia asks to run home to arrange childcare before the session.

                    SCREENPLAY
          ========================================

INT. QUANTUM LOGISTICS BUILDING - LAB AREA - CONTINUOUS

The team gathers around Nina at the terminal. The sof-tak skin with "WE'RE ALL DYING" sits on the desk nearby - a
constant reminder.

Nina pulls up data visualizations on the screen.

                    NINA
          The data from the last forty-eight
          hours shows an acceleration pattern.

She pulls up a graph - exponential curve climbing sharply.

                    NINA (CONT'D)
          The cube is acting like a singularity.
          A black hole. Actively pulling in
          other cubes regardless of their
          dimensionality.

She cycles through images: n=0 coordinates disappearing, n=3 structures warping, n=4 signatures collapsing.

                    RASHID
          All of them?

                    NINA
          All of them. Singularities, three-space,
          hypercubes. Root-space doesn't
          discriminate.

Lea leans forward, studying the slide.

                    LEA
          That's... that shouldn't be possible.

                    NINA
          It is if the fractional dimension is
          unstable by nature.

Nina pulls up a fractal triangle diagram - the Sierpiński triangle. She animates it, showing how each iteration adds more
sides, recursively growing.

                    NINA (CONT'D)
          Our experiments may have excited
          some quantum state. But this behavior
          is fundamental to fractional dimensions.

She points to the animation.

                    NINA (CONT'D)
          The state is very unstable.
          It needs to add mass to regain stability. And now it's adding that mass by itself.

The fractal expands on screen - consuming, growing, recursive.

                    SOFIA
          So, um... it's eating?

                    NINA
          Yes but just other cubes.

Silence. The weight settles.

Then chaos erupts. Multiple voices overlapping:

                    CHEN
          How fast is the acceleration—

                    RASHID
          Can we calculate the mass threshold—

                    YUKI
          If it's recursive then the timeline—

                    SOFIA
          Wait, what does this mean for—

                    LEA
          We need to shut down the transmitter
          immediately—

                    DARIUS
          Does this mean Earth—

The voices build on top of each other - panic mixing with scientific curiosity. Alex stands back, observing. Marcus rubs
his face, stressed.

Edgar watches, processing. Then:

                    EDGAR
          Hold on. Hold on!

The room quiets. Edgar steps forward.

                    EDGAR (CONT'D)
          You said it's pulling in other cubes.
          So we have to retreive them as well?

Nina turns to him.

                    NINA
          Retreiving them will likely excite the root-cube again, pulling more in.

Edgar's face changes. The corporate confidence drains. His hand grips the edge of the desk.

                    EDGAR
          Jesus Christ.

Beat. The room is silent now. Edgar stares at the fractal on screen - the relentless, recursive expansion.

                    EDGAR (CONT'D)
               (quietly)
          How long have you known about this?

Marcus just found out, like Nina said earlier.

                    MARCUS
          The acceleration started two days ago.
          But the fundamental instability—

                    EDGAR
          Two days?

He looks at Marcus. Something breaks.

                    EDGAR (CONT'D)
          We've been... I've been treating this
          like a staffing issue. Like a budget
          problem.

Sofia stares at him. So does Alex.

                    MARCUS
          Edgar, we need to—

                    EDGAR
          How did this get so... how did we let
          it get this desperate?

No one answers. Marcus looks down.

Edgar breathes. Steadies himself. When he speaks again, his voice is different - still shaken, but focused.

                    EDGAR (CONT'D)
          Okay. Okay. We can't... we need a plan.

He looks around the room.

                    EDGAR (CONT'D)
          Barry and Josh. The people trapped
          inside. We treat them like astronauts.
          They're alive. They can help us by
          staying alive and providing data from
          inside.

                    LEA
          We need to rescue them—

                    EDGAR
          We can't. Not yet. We don't understand
          the environment. We send people in
          blind, we lose more.

Lea's jaw tightens, but she doesn't argue.

                    EDGAR (CONT'D)
          We prepare an expedition kit. Food,
          measurement equipment, communication
          devices.

                    ALEX
          We can actually help with that.

Edgar turns to her.

                    ALEX (CONT'D)
          The food supply. We've been shrinking
          sof-tak down for portability. We can
          compress months of food into a small
          package.

                    EDGAR
          That's... yes. Good. Do it. We send it through to them and that's the last thing we send til we solve this.

Alex nods to Morris and Darius.

                    ALEX
          Start pulling the sof-tak we brought
          over. Get the compression equipment set
          up.

Morris and Darius exchange a glance, then nod and head toward the supply boxes.

                    MARCUS
          We have measurement tools. Dimensional
          sensors, communication relays. We can
          pack them into a kit.

                    EDGAR
          How long to assemble it?

                    MARCUS
          A couple hours max. If we work quickly.

                    LEA
          We have to be careful. Someone else
          could get sucked in while we're
          sending it.

Marcus exhales - frustrated, exhausted.

                    MARCUS
          I don't have many options here. We need
          to get supplies to Barry and Josh. The
          longer they're without food, the worse
          their chances.

                    LEA
          Then we decide safety protocols.
          Distance requirements. No one works
          alone near the—

                    EDGAR
               (interrupting)
          I'll stand closest to the kit.

Everyone looks at him.

                    EDGAR (CONT'D)
          If it makes you feel better. I'll be
          the one at risk.

Lea and Alex exchange a glance. Alex studies Edgar - this is new.

                    ALEX
          You understand what you're saying.

                    EDGAR
          I understand.

Beat.

                    ALEX
          Ok?

                    LEA
               (to Alex)
          For now.

Alex nods. They back off.

                    NINA
          It's almost 5pm now.

                    EDGAR
          Late-night session then.

                    MARCUS
          You heard him.

The team begins to disperse. Morris and Darius are already pulling sof-tak samples. Chen starts organizing measurement
tools. Rashid and Yuki confer quietly.

Sofia approaches Alex.

                    SOFIA
          Can I run home quick before we start
          tonight?

                    ALEX
          Of course. Your kids?

                    SOFIA
          Need to make sure they're settled with
          my sister. This is going to be a long
          night.

                    ALEX
          Go. I'll see you at 7.

Sofia nods gratefully and heads out.

Alex watches the team work. Lea stands beside her, both looking at Edgar - who's staring at the fractal triangle still
spinning on the monitor.

                    LEA
               (quietly, to Alex)
          He finally gets it.

                    ALEX
          Yeah.

                    LEA
          Too late.

                    ALEX
          Maybe.

Edgar turns, catches them looking. He holds Alex's gaze for a moment, then turns back to Marcus to discuss logistics.

Alex picks up the sof-tak skin. The message carved into it:

"WE'RE ALL DYING."

She sets it down and goes to help Morris with the compression equipment.
