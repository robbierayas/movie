FADE IN:

EXT. INZO FACILITY - MORNING

A massive corporate building rises against the sky. Modern, sterile architecture. The logo "INZO" gleams on the facade.

INT. INZO FACILITY - LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

ALEX (30s, practical, focused) walks through the pristine lobby carrying a coffee, wearing backpack and noise-cancelling
big headphones. Employees bustle past in business and casual attire with difference between scientists and business
people obvious.

WALL-MOUNTED TV SCREENS display company video explaining sof-tak and company profits from it. Bottom graphic: "sof-tak:
Stock increase despite flavor concerns". Alex intentionally looks away and it is clear her badge says Food
Experimentation. Video ends and next video starts showing diagram version of hypercube and bottom graphic "INZO:
Ruthless, relentless, innovative"

Alex passes through security scanners without breaking stride.

INT. INZO FACILITY - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Alex walks down a long corridor. By this point, the coffee is finished and she is reading a phone-like device. The LEFT
WALL is a massive painted TIMELINE - corporate history stretching back decades.

Alex continues walking, eyes on phone:

- "FOUNDED 1977" in bold letters
- "1000 FACILITIES - 2005" with a world map
- "N=3 CUBE PROTOTYPE COMPLETE - 2010" with technical diagrams

Further down, several entries have their DATES PAINTED OVER in black:

- [REDACTED] - "1M PRISONERS"
- [REDACTED] - "FOOD SCIENCE BREAKTHROUGH - SOF-TAK DEVELOPED"
- [REDACTED] - "EXTRASPATIAL FACILITY ESTABLISHED"
- [REDACTED] - "SINGULARITY FACILITY APPROVED"

Without breaking stride or looking, Alex reaches her hand to tap "SOF-TAK DEVELOPED" and you can see it is slightly faded
from the touching.

INT. FOOD SCIENCE LAB - DAY

Sterile white lab. Workbenches covered with equipment - microscopes, containment chambers, precision tools.

MORRIS (40s, disheveled, perpetually sniffly) hunches over a workstation, adjusting goggles that keep sliding down his
nose.

Alex enters, setting down coffee.

                    ALEX
          Morning, Morris.

Morris jumps slightly, knocking over a beaker (empty).

                    MORRIS
          Jesus! Alex. You scared me.

Morris picks up empty beaker, knocking over a full beaker.

Alex gives him a look.

                    MORRIS (CONT'D)
          I meant to do that. I was about to start cleaning and there was no mess.

Alex pulls on a lab coat, moves to her station.

                    ALEX
          What is this meeting about?

                    MORRIS
          I dunno.

Alex pulls out a LARGE BROWN BALL in a tray - the "SOF-TAK" - looks like a large dungball. Alex starts a voice recorder

                    ALEX
          Verifying molecular stability...

Alex scans it with handheld scanner.

                    ALEX (CONT'D)
          Check

Morris grabs a piece of the ball showing green inside with orange spots and puts the piece in his mouth. As he reaches
for another, Alex slaps his hand softly away.

                    ALEX (CONT'D)
          Structural stability compromised, but within limits.

Alex uses a dropper to drop a chemical on the ball.

The sof-tak begins to SHRINK - rapidly getting smaller and smaller until it's the size of a grain of rice... then dust...
then gone.

                    ALEX
          Compression successful. Retrieving
          sample.

Alex picks up an EYEDROPPER filled with clear liquid - the GROW DROP.

                    MORRIS
          Can you even see it?

                    ALEX
          No. That's the point.

Morris leans in close, squinting at the empty plate.

                    ALEX (CONT'D)
          Okay, applying restoration
          solution in three... two...

ACHOO! Morris sneezes violently toward the plate.

Alex freezes, horror dawning.

                    ALEX (CONT'D)
          Did you just...?

                    MORRIS
               (nasally)
          I sneezed near it, not AT it. It's still there. I see it.

Alex stares at the plate, which now could have nothing on it. The microscopic sof-tak could be anywhere - on Morris's
face, on the floor, in the air.

                    ALEX
               (defeated)
          There's only one way to find out.

Alex holds the eyedropper over the plate, hand shaking slightly.

Alex squeezes. A single DROP falls onto the ceramic plate.

They both lean in, watching.

Nothing happens.

Beat.

                    ALEX
          Better think up a good excuse.

                    MORRIS
          The solutions got mixed. Instead of shrinking, it grew legs and walked out.

Alex sighs at plate. Suddenly, a TINY SPECK on the edge of the plate - previously invisible - ROLLS into the grow drop.

INSTANTLY, the sof-tak EXPLODES back to full size with a wet THWAP, filling the plate and continuing to roll, goes off
the tray a bit onto the table.

Alex and Morris jump back.

Beat.

They look at each other.

                    MORRIS (CONT'D)
          ...Oh, right there!

Alex shakes her head, but can't help a small smile. Grabs her tools to take measurements

FADE OUT.
