INT. QUANTUM LOGISTICS LAB - DAY

A framed photo on a desk. Barry with his wife and two young children at a beach. The same man from the ID badge in Scene 5. Happy. Alive.

Behind the photo: an empty chair. A cold cup of coffee. An unfinished calculation on a notepad. Pens scattered. A workspace abandoned mid-thought.

The lab stretches beyond - banks of equipment, monitors displaying dimensional coordinates, whiteboards covered in equations, a large apparatus dominating one wall labeled "ROOT-SPACE TRANSMITTER - HANDLE WITH CARE."

The non-manager team files in through the door. Morris, Darius, Sofia, Nina, Rashid, Chen, Yuki. Looking around with curiosity and uncertainty.

The team spreads out, exploring. Morris drifts toward the equipment. Darius heads straight for the large transmitter apparatus. Sofia and Nina move toward the chalkboard. Rashid and Yuki follow.

Darius moves toward the transmitter.

                    DARIUS
          This is the root-space transmitter?

Chen stands near it, arms crossed.

                    CHEN
          That's it.

Darius walks around it slowly, examining.

                    DARIUS
          How does it work?

Chen raises an eyebrow.

                    CHEN
          You mean besides the dimensional
          compression? When it's really running,
          we have to keep the core suspended in
          anti-plasma or it will overheat.

                    DARIUS
          Oh sweet, I didn't know about that
          part. And you do it all by yourself?

Chen shrugs.

                    CHEN
          I understand enough to run it. Barry
          and I built it together. He handled
          the theory. I handled making it not
          explode.

Morris stands by the chalkboard across the room. He nods at it.

                    MORRIS
          Are these the equations for dimensional
          transition?

Nina and Sofia stand at the board. Nina studies it.

                    NINA
          Part of it. The memory erasure problem
          is what happens when you come BACK.
          When people return from root-space to
          normal space, they lose their memories.

                    MORRIS
          Like... all their memories?

Sofia notices Barry's desk nearby—the photo, the cold coffee. She moves toward it.

Nina gestures to Morris, trying to explain.

                    NINA
          Most of them. It's the stabilization
          process—when your dimensional vibration
          shifts back to n=3, the memory
          information gets lost with the current
          translation. Like... imagine shaking a
          snow globe. All that information just...
          disperses.

Morris nods slowly. Concern crosses his face.

                    MORRIS
          But it's not necessarily lost yet.

Yuki squints at the chalkboard.

                    YUKI
          Wait—this equation is wrong.

She reaches for the chalk without thinking, peers closer.

                    YUKI
          The denominator should be squared.

Rashid peers at the board.

                    RASHID
          Oh. Yeah.

Yuki picks up the chalk and corrects it mid-conversation, instinctive.

                    MORRIS
          Can it be prevented? The memory loss?

Nina shakes her head.

                    NINA
          We don't know. That's the problem we're
          trying to solve.

Nina grins despite herself at Yuki.

                    NINA
          That's been wrong for three weeks.

Rashid's slight smile.

                    RASHID
          Barry kept saying he'd fix it.

Sofia stands at Barry's desk. Her voice quiet.

                    SOFIA
          This was Barry's workspace?

The mathematicians' brief laugh dies. Chen's jaw tightens from across the room.

                    CHEN
          Yeah. He left that coffee two weeks
          ago. Never came back to finish it.

A beat. The weight of that settles. Sofia looks at the photo—Barry with his wife and children. Her expression hardens—a mother recognizing another parent.

Darius speaks quietly to Sofia.

                    DARIUS
          He has kids, too.

Silence for a moment. The levity gone. Morris picks up a tool from the workbench, examines it, sets it down carefully. Darius watches from the transmitter. Sofia moves back toward the group.

                    SOFIA
          So if you guys have never tried sof-tak,
          Morris makes a mean one. Morris, do you
          remember when I invited you to my
          family's formal dinner? I told you to
          bring something nice. Not sof-tak.

Morris looks up, surprised by the shift.

                    MORRIS
          Well, I thought—I mean, it's nutritious
          and—

Darius smirks from the transmitter.

                    DARIUS
          You already know he still brought
          sof-tak.

Sofia laughs warmly.

                    SOFIA
          Darius was there. Everyone loved him.
          Morris? He made it into a casserole.

The team laughs—warm, bonding. The heaviness lifts slightly. Morris ducks his head, embarrassed but pleased.

                    SOFIA
          My mother-in-law thought it was
          impressive.

                    DARIUS
          Can you show us how it works? The
          transmitter?

Chen shifts uncomfortably.

                    CHEN
          You want a demonstration?

                    DARIUS
          Would be cool to see it in action.
          Sending something through.

Chen looks at the transmitter, then back at them. Something flickers in his expression—fear, maybe guilt.

Chen's voice careful.

                    CHEN
          As long as it's not alive.

A beat. Morris catches the specific phrasing.

                    MORRIS
          Not... alive? Like, you mean, um,
          organic matter has different—

Chen's tone firm.

                    CHEN
          Nothing alive. That's the rule.

Sofia's voice light, diffusing tension.

                    SOFIA
          Well, we're not going to send a person
          through, Chen.

Chen doesn't smile.

                    CHEN
          Good.

                    NINA
          What about something simple? Just to
          show the transition?

Morris fumbles in his backpack, pulls out a container.

                    MORRIS
          Oh! I have—well, I brought some sof-tak.
          For, um, snacking. It's basketball-sized?
          Would that work?

                    CHEN
          Sof-tak works. Set it on the platform.

Morris places the basketball-sized sof-tak on the transmitter platform. The team gathers around—curious, excited. Chen moves to the control panel.

Chen's hands on the controls.

                    CHEN
          Dimensional inversion in three... two...
          one.

He presses the button.

The transmitter HUMS—a deep, resonant sound. The air around the sof-tak begins to SHIMMER. Light bends. The sof-tak appears to COMPRESS—not getting smaller in a normal sense, but folding into itself impossibly. Dimensions collapsing.

Morris whispers, awed.

                    MORRIS
          It's beautiful...

Nina watches intently.

                    NINA
          The spatial coordinates are just...
          vanishing.

Yuki speaks fast to Rashid.

                    YUKI
          Can you even measure zero dimensions?

Rashid responds fast.

                    RASHID
          Theoretically? It's a singularity point—

                    DARIUS
          It's gone.

The sof-tak has disappeared completely. The platform is empty.

Chen nods, satisfied.

                    CHEN
          Transmission successful. Object now
          exists in root-space.

                    MORRIS
          And it's... I mean, it's somewhere,
          right? Not just destroyed?

                    CHEN
          Not destroyed. Compressed. All its
          matter still exists—just occupying
          point-three-three-three spatial
          dimensions.

                    SOFIA
          Can you bring it back?

Chen shakes his head.

                    CHEN
          One-way trip. We can send things to
          root-space, but we haven't figured out
          retrieval. That's the problem.

Nina exchanges a look with Rashid and Yuki. The implication settles: Barry is trapped there too.

Chen begins shutting down the transmitter.

                    CHEN
          That's the demo. Nothing fancy. Just—

A SOUND. A mechanical CLUNK from the transmitter.

Everyone freezes.

Chen frowns.

                    CHEN
          That's not supposed to—

Another CLUNK. Then a HISS. Part of the platform SHIMMERS again.

                    NINA
          Chen, what's happening?

                    CHEN
          I don't know. The transmitter shouldn't—

Something MATERIALIZES on the platform. A fragment. A piece of the sof-tak's outer skin—torn, ragged.

Morris points.

                    MORRIS
          That's... that's part of the sof-tak.
          It came back?

Chen moves closer, cautious. Picks it up. Turns it over.

His expression changes. Horror.

                    DARIUS
          What is it?

Chen doesn't answer. Just holds it up.

Scratched into the sof-tak skin, crude and desperate:

**WE'RE ALL DYING**

Silence.

Sofia's voice quiet.

                    SOFIA
          Who wrote this?

Morris stares.

                    MORRIS
          That's... I mean, that just went
          through. We just sent it. Like, thirty
          seconds ago.

Darius, sharp.

                    DARIUS
          Barry. Or whoever's with him.

Nina realizes.

                    NINA
          They're in root-space with it. The
          sof-tak appeared there—

Chen interrupts, voice tight.

                    CHEN
          They grabbed it. Scratched a message.
          Sent it back through.

Yuki whispers.

                    YUKI
          They're conscious. They're aware in
          there.

                    RASHID
          And they're dying.

Morris takes the fragment from Chen's hands, staring at the message. His face has gone pale.

                    MORRIS
          This is... this is probably the most
          concerning thing—I mean, not probably,
          it definitely is. The message. Not the
          sof-tak. Well, both. But mainly—

He trails off, lost.

Darius speaks to Chen.

                    DARIUS
          When you sent the sof-tak through—they
          must have been just... right there.
          Waiting. Hoping.

Chen's voice barely audible.

                    CHEN
          Yeah.

Sofia challenges, direct.

                    SOFIA
          And you all kept working? Kept
          researching? People are trapped and
          dying in another dimension, and INZO
          has a staff meeting?

Chen doesn't answer. Can't meet her eyes.

Morris still holds the fragment, reading the message over and over. Darius watches Chen carefully. Sofia's expression has hardened—the same look she had when Edgar dismissed her safety concerns.

FADE TO BLACK.
