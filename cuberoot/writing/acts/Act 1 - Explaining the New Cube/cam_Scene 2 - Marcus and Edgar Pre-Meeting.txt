INT. INZO FACILITY - HALLWAY OUTSIDE EDGAR'S OFFICE - DAY

MARCUS (late 30s, focused, pragmatic) stands in the hallway, arms crossed, watching a WALL-MOUNTED SCREEN.

ON SCREEN: Corporate video with sleek graphics shows rotating 3D models of cube structures. Professional NARRATOR voice-over.

                    NARRATOR (V.O.)
          Quantum Logistics Division continues
          to pioneer dimensional efficiency
          solutions, optimizing space-time
          resource allocation for modern
          correctional infrastructure.

The video shows sanitized animations of prisoners entering cube rooms - looks safe, clean, futuristic.

                    NARRATOR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          Our proprietary n-dimensional
          containment systems provide cost-
          effective solutions...

The video shows prisoners in mess hall each with a sof-tak ball on their plate.

                    NARRATOR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          for maintaining humane environments
          for our users...

Marcus lets out a quiet, bitter laugh. Shakes his head slightly.

Marcus speaks under his breath.

                    MARCUS
          Humane.

The office door with sign "Head of Logistics" opens. A BUSINESS EXECUTIVE exits, shaking hands with EDGAR (50s, polished, corporate VP in pressed suit).

                    EDGAR
          Great, let's circle back on those KPIs
          next week. Really appreciate your
          bandwidth on this.

                    EXECUTIVE
          Absolutely. Synergy across divisions

The two do a hand wave/shake to symbolize synergy flowing and both laugh. The Executive leaves. Edgar notices Marcus, his demeanor brightens.

                    EDGAR (CONT'D)
          Marcus! Mr. Quantum! Perfect timing.
          Come on in.

Marcus follows Edgar into the office.

INT. EDGAR'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Typical corporate VP office - motivational posters, awards, organized desk. Edgar gestures to a chair as he settles behind his desk.

                    EDGAR
          So, you know I'm just regular
          logistics and this quantum stuff is
          all new to me. Jefe there had some
          worries so I'll be more hands-on. Now
          give me the full breakdown.

Marcus shifts uncomfortably, shifts into science explanation mode.

                    MARCUS
          The extraction is showing promise.
          We're seeing information come through
          with more frequency and--

Edgar interrupts, friendly.

                    EDGAR
          Sorry, I should clarify. I meant the
          team transition. How's the integration
          going?

Beat. Marcus recalibrates and relaxes, since he does not have to explain yet.

                    MARCUS
          Right. The team.

                    EDGAR
          The science stuff, that's your
          department. I trust you've got it
          handled. I'm more concerned with the
          dollarinos. I don't want these guys
          getting paid to do nothing.

Marcus's voice is measured.

                    MARCUS
          The integration is... proceeding. We're
          bringing in Alex and three others from
          Food Science. Their experience with
          dimensional compression could
          translate well.

Edgar pulls up a tablet, scrolling through what appears to be an org chart.

                    EDGAR
          And knowing dimensional compression
          helps with your re-biggification?

                    MARCUS
          Yes..technically.

                    EDGAR
          Perfect. We'll all avoid en-shit-
          ification then.

Edgar laughs.

                    EDGAR (CONT'D)
          Alex, yes. I see that name a lot for
          sof-tak.

Marcus's expression darkens slightly at the mention of sof-tak - he considers it far beneath his level.

                    MARCUS
          She's competent. They all are.

                    EDGAR
          And they're up to speed?

                    MARCUS
          We're coordinating currently. The team
          meeting starts in a few minutes. First
          session with the combined group.

Edgar stands, grabbing his tablet.

Edgar nods approvingly.

                    EDGAR
          I'm actually free should sit in on
          that. Good to show leadership support
          during transitions. Plus, on the ground
          level you can see the real dirt.

Marcus stands as well, a flicker of concern crosses his face.

                    MARCUS
          It's going to be fairly technical.
          Dimensional mathematics, quantum
          containment protocols--

Edgar's voice is serious.

                    EDGAR
          I also need to make sure the team is
          run well. Since we're giving Quantum
          Logistics these resources, we're
          expecting you can hit all Q3
          deliverables. Or we're both going to
          need to explain.

Edgar moves toward the door, Marcus follows with visible hesitation.

Edgar's voice is calm.

                    EDGAR (CONT'D)
          But you just make sure everyone keeps
          attacking the crap pile, keep them
          working toward the same goal.

                    MARCUS
          De-shittification?

Edgar smiles, pointing at Marcus.

                    EDGAR
          Close. Profit maximization!

Marcus pauses at the door, something unspoken in his expression.

Marcus gives an uncertain smile.

                    MARCUS
          Synergy.

But the way he says it suggests he doesn't quite believe it.

                    EDGAR
          Synergy indeed.

They exit the office together. Edgar cheerful and oblivious, starting to describe old transitions. Marcus carrying the weight of what he knows.

FADE OUT.
