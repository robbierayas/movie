SCENE 6 - LAB INTRODUCTION AND FIRST TEST
==========================================

LOCATION: Quantum Logistics lab area

CHARACTERS:
- MORRIS - Food scientist, smart but uncertain
- DARIUS - Food scientist, precise and questioning
- SOFIA - Lab chemist, pragmatic mother
- NINA - Mathematician, youngest
- RASHID - Background mathematician
- CHEN - Electrical engineer, practical
- YUKI - Background mathematician

(Non-manager characters only - Marcus and Edgar not present)

SCENE LAYOUT:

1. TRANSITION FROM SCENE 5
   - Scene 5 ends focusing on Barry's badge picture
   - Scene 6 opens on Barry's family photo on his desk in QL lab
   - Camera zooms out to reveal lab area
   - Barry's empty chair, abandoned workspace
   - Subtle signs of absence - coffee mug, unfinished work

2. TEAM ARRIVES IN LAB
   - Non-manager characters file into the lab area
   - General getting-to-know-you atmosphere
   - People poking around, examining equipment
      - Darius asks Chen about the root-space transmitter - how it works . Darius doesn't understand answer but shares
   enthusiasm.
   - Morris asks about equations on the chalkboard - curious about the science
   - Questions being asked between team members

3. COMIC RELIEF MOMENTS
      - Sofia tells story about inviting Morris to her family's formal dinner, she told him to bring something nice not
   sof-tak, Darius jumps in "You already know he still brought sof-tak", Sofia says "Darius was there everyone loved him"
   and laughs finishing "He made it into a casserole", warm bonding moment over Morris's quirks
      - Yuki corrects something written on the chalkboard mid-conversation, can't help herself, Nina grins "That's been
   wrong for three weeks", Rashid adds "Barry kept saying he'd fix it", all three mathematicians laugh
   - Light banter and exploration
   - Team members interacting casually
   - Brief levity before the horror

3.5. NINA EXPLAINS MEMORY ERASURE TO MORRIS
   - Nina explaining the memory erasure problem to Morris
   - Morris listening, asking questions
      - Nina: "The problem is what happens when you come BACK. When people return from root-space to normal space, they
   lose their memories."
   - Morris: "Like... all their memories?"
      - Nina: "Most of them. It's the stabilization process—when your dimensional vibration shifts back to n=3, the
   memory information encoded in the vibration gets lost. Like... imagine shaking a snow globe. All that information
   just... disperses."
   - Morris nods, concerned: "Can it be prevented?"
   - Nina: "We don't know. That's the problem we're trying to solve."

4. CHEN DEMO REQUEST
   - Someone asks Chen to demonstrate root-space transmitter
   - Chen looks momentarily scared
   - "As long as it's not alive"

5. SOF-TAK SUGGESTION
   - Someone suggests using sof-tak for the demo
   - Basketball-size sof-tak is prepared

6. THE TRANSMISSION
   - Sof-tak is sent through
   - Cool visual effect as it disappears into root-space
   - Chen gives thumbs up to others
   - Successful test

7. SHUTTING DOWN - THE MESSAGE
   - Chen begins shutting down the transmitter
   - Darius jokes to Sofia "probably not getting that back"
   - Part of the sof-tak skin comes back through
   - Message scratched into it: "WE'RE ALL DYING"
   - Horror realization

TONE: Starts casual and friendly, builds to horror reveal
DYNAMICS: Team bonding, Chen as practical demonstrator, shift from levity to dread
KEY TENSION: What happened to the person from Scene 5? What is the root-space transmitter? Why does the message come
back?

NOTES:
- Establishes the lab environment and equipment
- Shows team dynamics in casual setting
- Demonstrates the root-space technology visually
- Horror reveal that people are trapped and suffering in root-space
- Connects to Lea's emotional warning about losing people
- Chen's fear of sending something "alive" foreshadows the danger
- The scratched message suggests people in root-space are conscious and desperate
- Barry's workspace shows recent absence - he worked with Chen on instrumentation
- Josh (also trapped) was a theoretical physicist with math focus, 30s
- Josh and Lea had unspoken romantic feelings (pre-relationship phase)
- This adds emotional weight to Lea's distress about losing people

                    SCREENPLAY
          ========================================

INT. QUANTUM LOGISTICS LAB - DAY

CLOSE ON: A framed photo on a desk. Barry with his wife and two young children at a beach. The same man from the ID badge
in Scene 5. Happy. Alive.

The camera pulls back slowly.

Behind the photo: an empty chair. A cold cup of coffee. An unfinished calculation on a notepad. Pens scattered. A
workspace abandoned mid-thought.

The lab stretches beyond - banks of equipment, monitors displaying dimensional coordinates, whiteboards covered in
equations,
a large apparatus dominating one wall labeled "ROOT-SPACE TRANSMITTER - HANDLE WITH CARE."

WIDER: The non-manager team files in through the door. Morris, Darius, Sofia, Nina, Rashid, Chen, Yuki. Looking around
with curiosity and uncertainty.

The team spreads out, exploring. Morris drifts toward the equipment. Darius heads straight for the large transmitter
apparatus. Sofia and Nina move toward the chalkboard. Rashid and Yuki follow.

Darius moves toward the transmitter.

                    DARIUS
          This is the zero-space transmitter?

Chen nods, arms crossed.

                    CHEN
          Root-space. That's it.

Darius walks around it slowly, examining.

                    DARIUS
          How does it work?

Chen raises an eyebrow.

                    CHEN
          You mean besides the dimensional
          translation? When it's really running,
          we have to keep the core suspended in
          anti-plasma or it will overheat.

                    DARIUS
          Oh sweet, I didn't know about that
          part. And you do it all by yourself?

Chen shrugs.

                    CHEN
          I understand enough to run it. Barry
          and I built it together. He handled
          the theory. I handled making it not
          explode.

Morris nods at the chalkboard, standing by it across the room.

                    MORRIS
          Are these the equations for dimensional
          transition?

Nina studies the board.

                    NINA
          Part of it. The memory erasure problem
          is what happens when you come BACK.
          When people return to
          normal space, they lose their memories.

                    MORRIS
          Like... all their memories?

Meanwhile, Sofia notices Barry's desk nearby—the photo, the cold coffee. She moves toward it.

Nina gestures to Morris, trying to explain.

                    NINA
          Most of them. It's the stabilization
          process—when your dimensional vibration
          shifts back to n=3, the memory
          information gets lost with the current
          translation. Like... imagine shaking a
          snow globe. All that information just...
          disperses.

Morris nods slowly, concern crossing his face.

                    MORRIS
          But it's not necessarily lost yet.

Yuki squints at the chalkboard.

                    YUKI
          Wait—this equation is wrong.

                    MORRIS
          Can it be prevented? The memory loss?

She reaches for the chalk without thinking, peers closer.

                    YUKI
          The denominator should be squared.

Nina shakes her head.

                    NINA
          We don't know. That's the problem we're
          trying to solve.

Yuki picks up the chalk and corrects it mid-conversation, instinctive. Rashid peers at the board.

                    RASHID
          Oh. Yeah.

Nina grins despite herself at Yuki.

                    NINA
          That's been wrong for three weeks.

Rashid with a slight smile.

                    RASHID
          Barry kept saying he'd fix it.

Sofia at Barry's desk, her voice quiet.

                    SOFIA
          This was Barry's workspace?

The mathematicians' brief laugh dies. Chen's jaw tightens from across the room.

                    CHEN
          Yeah. He hasn't been here. Fourteen days.

A beat. The weight of that settles. Sofia looks at the photo—Barry with his wife and children. Her expression hardens—a
mother recognizing another parent.

Darius quietly to Sofia.

                    DARIUS
          He has kids, too.

Silence for a moment. The levity gone. Morris picks up a tool from the workbench, examines it, sets it down carefully.
Darius watches from the transmitter. Sofia, sorry she brought it up, moves back toward the group.

                    SOFIA
          So if you guys have never tried sof-tak,
          Morris makes a mean one. Morris, do you
          remember when I invited you to my
          parents' 50th dinner? I told you to
          bring something nice. Not sof-tak.

Morris looks up, surprised by the shift.

                    MORRIS
          Well, I thought—I mean, it's nutritious
          and—

Darius smirks from the transmitter.

                    DARIUS
          You already know he still brought
          sof-tak.

Sofia laughs warmly.

                    SOFIA
          Darius was there. Everyone loved him.
          Morris? He made it into a casserole.

The team laughs—warm, bonding. The heaviness lifts slightly. Morris ducks his head, embarrassed but pleased.

                    SOFIA
          My mother-in-law thought it was impressive.

Darius turns to Chen.
                    DARIUS
          Can you show us how it works? The transmitter?

Chen shifts uncomfortably.
                    CHEN
          You want a demonstration?

                    DARIUS
          Would be cool to see it in action. Sending something through.

Chen looks at the transmitter, then back at them. Something flickers in his expression—fear, maybe guilt.

Chen speaks carefully.
                    CHEN
          As long as it's not alive.

A beat. Morris catches the specific phrasing.

                    MORRIS
          Not... alive? Like, you mean, um, organic matter has different—

Chen, firm.
                    CHEN
          Nothing alive. That's the rule.

Sofia, her voice light, diffusing tension.
                    SOFIA
          Well, we're not going to send a person through, Chen.

Chen doesn't smile.
                    CHEN
          Good.

                    NINA
          What about something simple? Just to show the transition?

Morris fumbles in his backpack, pulls out a container.

                    MORRIS
          Oh! I have—well, I brought some sof-tak. For, um, snacking. It's basketball-sized? Would that work?

                    CHEN
          Sof-tak works. Set it on the platform.

Morris places the basketball-sized sof-tak on the transmitter platform. The team gathers around—curious, excited. Chen
moves to the control panel.

Chen, hands on the controls.
                    CHEN
          Dimensional inversion in three... two... one.

He presses the button.

The transmitter HUMS—a deep, resonant sound. The air around the sof-tak begins to SHIMMER. Light bends. The sof-tak
appears to COMPRESS—not getting smaller in a normal sense, but folding into itself impossibly. Dimensions collapsing.

Morris whispers, awed.
                    MORRIS
         Amazing...

                    DARIUS
          It's gone.

The sof-tak has disappeared completely. The platform is empty.

Chen nods, satisfied.
                    CHEN
          Transmission successful. Object now exists in root-space.

                    MORRIS
          And it's... I mean, it's somewhere, right? Not just destroyed?

                    CHEN
                    Not destroyed. Compressed. All its matter still exists—just occupying point-three-three-three spatial
          dimensions.

                    SOFIA
          Can you bring it back?

Chen shakes his head.
                    CHEN
          One-way trip. We can send things to root-space, but we haven't figured out retrieval. That's the problem.

Nina exchanges a look with Rashid and Yuki. The implication settles: Barry is trapped there too.

Chen begins shutting down the transmitter.
                    CHEN
          That's the demo. Nothing fancy. Just—

A SOUND. A mechanical CLUNK from the transmitter.

Everyone freezes.

Chen frowns.
                    CHEN
          That's not supposed to—

Another CLUNK. Then a HISS. Part of the platform SHIMMERS again.

                    NINA
          Chen, what's happening?

                    CHEN
          I don't know. The transmitter shouldn't—

Something MATERIALIZES on the platform. A fragment. A piece of the sof-tak's outer skin—torn, ragged.

Morris points.
                    MORRIS
          That's... that's part of the sof-tak. It came back?

Chen moves closer, cautious. Picks it up. Turns it over.

His expression changes. Horror.

                    DARIUS
          What is it?

Chen doesn't answer. Just holds it up.

Scratched into the sof-tak skin, crude and desperate:

**WE'RE ALL DYING**

Silence.

Morris stares.
                    MORRIS
          That's... I mean, that just went through. We just sent it. Like, ten seconds ago.

Sofia, quietly.
                    SOFIA
          Who wrote this?

Darius, sharp.
                    DARIUS
          Barry? He's in there?

Nina, realizing she can speak without Marcus there.

                    NINA
          He tried something and made a mistake. Then Josh did the same. They're in root-space but ok.

Chen interrupts, voice tight.

                    CHEN
          They grabbed it. Scratched a message. Sent it back through.

Yuki continues Nina's explanation.

                    YUKI
                    We've been getting closer to bringing them back. Barry sends us data so we can keep calibrating.
          They're alive in there.

                    RASHID
          Well.. for now.

Morris takes the fragment from Chen's hands, staring at the message. His face has gone pale.

                    MORRIS
                    That's... that's probably the most concerning thing—I mean, not probably, it definitely is. The
          message. Not the sof-tak. It's just—
          (trails off, then stands resolutely with confident voice)
          Who ALL is really in there?... They must have been just... right there. Waiting.

Chen, barely audible.
                    CHEN
          Yeah. They shouldn't even be there.

Sofia, challenging and direct.
                    SOFIA
                    Someone is in there? And you all kept working? Kept researching? People are trapped and dying in another dimension, and
          INZO has a staff meeting?

Chen doesn't answer. Can't meet her eyes.

Darius turns to Nina.

                    DARIUS
          Before anyone turns that on again, explain this root space.

FADE TO BLACK.
