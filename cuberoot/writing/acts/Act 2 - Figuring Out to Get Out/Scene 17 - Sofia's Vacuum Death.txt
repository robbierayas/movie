Description:
Immediately after separating from Darius, the team enters a dissolution room where the floor slowly dissolves. They navigate it successfully and quickly, gaining false confidence ("That was... tame"). Marcus says "Maybe we're getting better at this." Morris says "Or maybe Darius was wrong about everything." Josh warns "The cube dampens. Then amplifies." but they don't listen. Opening the opposite door, they look through into Sofia's room - she's by a far exit door with her hand on a button. They yell "Sofia!" She turns, surprised and relieved: "Alex?!" She thinks it's the exit. Marcus urgently commands "Open it!" She presses the button. Josh shouts "DON'T—" but too late. The door opens to vacuum, not exit. Sofia's eyes widen in horror realizing what Marcus told her to do. She's violently sucked out into the void, her scream cutting off instantly. The vacuum pulls through both rooms. Team in the dissolution room screams, holding on - Lea and Alex nearly pulled through the doorway. The vacuum door closes automatically. Team survives, traumatized. Yuki breaks down completely - "DARIUS WAS RIGHT!" - screaming for him through the cube. Darius, two rooms away, hears the screaming and starts moving toward them.

FULL SCRIPT
================================================================================

FADE IN:

INT. ROOT CUBE - DISSOLUTION ROOM - CONTINUOUS

The team of NINE enters. White walls. The floor beneath them begins to CRACK and DISSOLVE - tiles breaking apart slowly.

CHEN sees it first.

                    CHEN
          Floor is acid. Move!

Team navigates across dissolving floor tiles. MARCUS directs.

                    MARCUS
          Jump the gaps. Don't stop.

Everyone makes it across quickly. Easy. They reach the opposite door, barely winded.

EDGAR looks back at the room, almost surprised.

                    EDGAR
          That was... tame.

MARCUS nods.

                    MARCUS
          Maybe we're getting better at this.

YUKI and NINA exchange a glance - annoyance and disgust. But say nothing.

MORRIS, gaining confidence.

                    MORRIS
          Or maybe Darius was wrong about
          everything.

JOSH turns sharply, uneasy.

                    JOSH
          The cube dampens. Then amplifies.

The team doesn't listen. They're confident now. They reach the opposite door and open it.

Through the doorway - a LARGER ROOM with multiple doors.

Across that room - SOFIA stands by a far door. Her hand on a button.

The team sees her through the doorway. Freezes.

                    ALEX
          Sofia!

SOFIA turns, surprised. Then relieved - her face lights up.

                    SOFIA
          Alex?!

A smile. Hope.

                    SOFIA (CONT'D)
          I think it's the exit!

MARCUS reacts instantly, urgent.

                    MARCUS
          Open it!

SOFIA presses the button. The door begins to open behind her.

JOSH shouts from the dissolution room.

                    JOSH
          DON'T—

Too late.

The door OPENS WIDE behind Sofia in the far room.

Not an exit. Just VOID. Endless black.

VACUUM.

AIR RUSHES OUT with a ROARING sound - through Sofia's room, through the doorway, into the dissolution room where the team stands.

SOFIA's eyes widen in horror. She realizes too late what Marcus told her to do.

She's SUCKED OUT VIOLENTLY - feet lifting off the ground.

Her SCREAM cuts off the instant she hits the vacuum.

Visible through the two doorways for one horrible moment - her body tumbling into endless void.

Gone.

The vacuum door stays open. Air PULLS through both rooms - from the dissolution room, through the doorway, through Sofia's room, into the void.

Team in the dissolution room SCREAMING, grabbing onto walls, doorframes, each other.

LEA and ALEX closest to the open doorway, nearly pulled through.

                    ALEX
          LEA!

                    LEA
          HOLD ON!

MARCUS and EDGAR brace against the dissolution room walls.

MORRIS clutches the doorframe of the entrance they came through, hyperventilating.

NINA and YUKI hold each other, sliding toward the doorway into Sofia's room.

CHEN grabs them, pulls them back.

Suddenly - the vacuum door in Sofia's room CLOSES SHUT on its own.

The cube knows when to close. Doesn't slice anyone.

Vacuum STOPS.

Silence. Just the team's ragged breathing.

Team collapses to the dissolution room floor, gasping.

INT. ROOT CUBE - DISSOLUTION ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

The team on the floor. Shaken. Traumatized. Still in the dissolution room.

YUKI crying, breaking down. MORRIS hyperventilating.

NINA holds YUKI, trying to comfort her.

ALEX stares at the open doorway into Sofia's room, devastated. Sofia. Gone.

EDGAR quiet, broken.

                    EDGAR
          She was right there...

LEA turns to JOSH, voice tight.

                    LEA
          You knew.

JOSH, cryptic as always.

                    JOSH
          The exits lie. Always.

YUKI pulls away from NINA, still crying.

                    YUKI
          We just... she just...

She looks at the team. At the leaders - Edgar, Marcus. Remembers DARIUS's words.

"Next time I see you? You're dead."

YUKI's voice cracks.

                    YUKI (CONT'D)
          Darius was right.

NINA reaches for her.

                    NINA
          Yuki, no—

YUKI louder, desperate.

                    YUKI
          DARIUS WAS RIGHT! He was RIGHT!

She turns toward the walls, SCREAMING.

                    YUKI (CONT'D)
          DARIUS! DARIUS!

ALEX moves toward her.

                    ALEX
          Yuki, stop—

But YUKI keeps screaming, voice raw.

                    YUKI
          DARIUS! WHERE ARE YOU?! YOU WERE
          RIGHT!

Her voice ECHOES through the cube. Bouncing off walls. Carrying.

INT. ROOT CUBE - TWO ROOMS AWAY - SAME TIME

DARIUS moves through a different room alone. Two heavy backpacks weighing him down.

He stops. Listening.

Faint SCREAMING. He can't make out words but he recognizes the voices.

He adjusts his pack. Starts moving toward the sound.

INT. ROOT CUBE - DISSOLUTION ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Team trying to calm YUKI in the dissolution room. She's still shaking, tears streaming.

NINA desperate, voice breaking.

                    NINA
          We can't... we can't fall apart now.

EDGAR stares through the doorway at Sofia's empty room, grief-stricken.

                    EDGAR
          She left for her kids. Never made it
          home.

MARCUS bitter, guilt crushing him.

                    MARCUS
          And never will now.

ALEX still staring through the doorway. Sofia was her teammate. She brought her into this. Her responsibility.

MORRIS shaking, voice uncertain and panicked.

                    MORRIS
          How do we get out if exits aren't
          real?

JOSH's answer, calm and inevitable.

                    JOSH
          Through. Not out. Through.

They can't stay here. The floor is still dissolving beneath them. And through that doorway is Sofia's empty room with the vacuum door.

YUKI still shaking. NINA supporting her, arm around her shoulders.

More desperate now. Darius's words echoing in their minds.

"Next time I see you? You're dead."

Sofia's dead.

FADE OUT.
