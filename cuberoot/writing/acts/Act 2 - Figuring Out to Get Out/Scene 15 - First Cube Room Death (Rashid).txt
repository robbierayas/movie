   - Morris unsure how to help, holds one chain to keep it from moving
   - Edgar: "How long will it take?"
   - Rashid: "Give me a few minutes."
   - Tile light sequence indicating timer starts.

4. WORKING THE PUZZLE
   - Rashid calculating sequence to unlock trap gets ankle and speaks tip to Yuki and Nina. They get the other ankle and a hand free
   - Rashid switches to neck and Nina and Yuki to the other hand
   - The others stay near doors away from corners
   - Marcus anxious, trying to stay calm
   - Alex reassuring them: "We're getting you out."
   - Josh watching, tense

CHARACTER DYNAMICS: Team collaboration turns to horror, Rashid's heroic sacrifice, first death under Edgar's leadership

================================================================================

Description:
Team enters mathematical trap room. Marcus accidentally triggers trap mechanism and gets caught by chains restraining his hands, ankles, and neck. Rashid, with help from Nina and Yuki, solves the complex mathematical puzzle to free Marcus. After successfully rescuing Marcus, Rashid lingers to study the mechanism for future encounters.

FADE IN:

INT. ROOT CUBE - TRAP ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Team cautiously near door they entered from. Unclear where danger could be.

JOSH stops at threshold.

                    JOSH
          Careful. The gradient is high in this
          area.

Team slowly steps forward, approaching cautiously. MARCUS scans the room.

                    MARCUS
          I see the pattern—

MARCUS steps toward center of room. His foot hits pressure plate.

SNAP!

CHAINS deploy from five corners - whip out and grab MARCUS by hands, ankles, and neck. Mathematical lock symbols glow on restraints.

                    MARCUS
               (struggling)
          What—

Chains tighten. Marcus suspended, can't free himself. Grimacing in pain.

                    ALEX
          Marcus!

Team rushes forward. RASHID, NINA, YUKI immediately examine mechanism.

                    RASHID
          Mathematical lock. Complex.

MARCUS trying to stay calm through pain.

                    MARCUS
          Can we break it?

CHEN studies mechanism from safe angle.

                    CHEN
          Might kill him if we force it.

RASHID analyzing symbols on restraints, finds pattern.

                    RASHID
          I can solve this. I haven't seen it
          since my thesis but I remember.

YUKI concerned, stepping closer.

                    YUKI
          Can you do it in time? Those are hard
          calculations in your head. Nina and I
          will help.

MORRIS unsure how to help, grabs one chain to keep it from moving.

EDGAR tense, watching.

                    EDGAR
          How long will it take?

RASHID focused on symbols.

                    RASHID
          Give me a few minutes.

Floor tiles begin GLOWING in sequence - timer starting. Light moves slowly across pattern.

RASHID calculates frantically, touching symbols. Gets ankle lock mechanism.

                    RASHID (CONT'D)
          Nina - sequence three-seven-five on
          the left ankle. Yuki - eight-two-one
          on the right hand.

NINA and YUKI work on their respective locks. Left ankle CLICKS FREE. Right hand CLICKS FREE.

                    RASHID (CONT'D)
          I'll take the neck. You two get the
          other hand.

NINA and YUKI move to other hand restraint.

Others stay near doors away from corners. DARIUS watches skeptically.

                    DARIUS
          What if we can't?

MARCUS through pain, voice strained.

                    MARCUS
          We can. Rashid's got this.

ALEX reassuring, moving closer.

                    ALEX
          We're getting you out.

JOSH watches from doorway, tense.

RASHID, NINA, YUKI working. Other hand CLICKS FREE.

Rashid switches to neck lock. More complex - more symbols, layered patterns.

Tile timer approaching end - halfway through now.

RASHID calculating, muttering numbers. Tries sequence. Wrong - mechanism buzzes.

                    RASHID
          No, no... let me recalculate...

Tile timer accelerating. Three quarters through.

RASHID frantically calculating. Finds sequence. Touches symbols in order.

                    RASHID (CONT'D)
          Final sequence - two-nine-four-six.

Mechanism CLICKS. RELEASES.

Marcus FALLS forward. LEA and EDGAR catch him.

Relief floods faces. NINA rushes to hug RASHID.

                    NINA
          You did it!

YUKI excited, smiling.

                    YUKI
          That was brilliant!

RASHID modest, slight smile.

                    RASHID
          Just math.

MARCUS rubbing restraint marks on wrists, catching breath.

                    MARCUS
               (to Rashid)
          Thank you.

MARCUS looks back at trap mechanism as team helps him away.

                    MARCUS (CONT'D)
          Make sure it doesn't hurt anyone else.

RASHID lingers by mechanism, examining symbols closely.

NINA calling from doorway.

                    NINA
          Rashid, come on. We need to go.

RASHID studying mechanism, tracing patterns.

                    RASHID
          Just one more second...

Trap REACTIVATES. Timer didn't restart - still at end.

Chains SNAP out. Catch RASHID by all limbs and neck.

Team SCREAMS. Rushes toward him.

                    YUKI
          RASHID!

Too fast. Chains tighten violently.

Rashid caught in deadly mechanism. Brutal. Fast.

                    NINA
          NO!

Mechanism CRUSHES. Rashid dies.

Victory to tragedy. Solved puzzle but trap killed him.

Team frozen in horror. First major death.

FADE TO:

INT. ROOT CUBE - BEYOND TRAP ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Team in next room, shaken. Some sitting, some standing.

MARCUS against wall, guilty expression. Difficulty justifying.

YUKI breaking down, crying. NINA beside her, both crying, comforting each other.

MORRIS pale, rambling nervously.

                    MORRIS
          Adaptive systems... the trap adapted...
          even after solving it... it was
          waiting for... I mean, it's like it
          knew someone would...

DARIUS bitter, cutting him off.

                    DARIUS
          We're going to die here.

ALEX stepping forward, trying to rally.

                    ALEX
          Rashid's death means something if we
          learn from it. Don't linger. Don't
          assume you're safe. Keep moving.

Everyone realizes she repeated a line from Josh.

EDGAR quiet. Processing. First death under his leadership. Weight visible.

LEA stays close to JOSH near corner.

JOSH cryptic, watching.

                    JOSH
          Keep moving. Never stop.

Team slowly gathers, devastated but determined.

                    EDGAR
          Keep moving. Honor Rashid by getting
          out.

Team proceeds toward next door. Grief and purpose. Rashid saved Marcus but cost his life.

FADE OUT.
