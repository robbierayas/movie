Yuki suddenly steps forward: "You were right" - grief over Rashid and Sofia has shattered her faith, probability of escape too low. Nina joins her, idealism curdled to disillusionment. Morris stammers apology to Alex, fear wins over loyalty. All three cross to Darius's side. Darius demands more supplies, Edgar refuses. Darius attacks Edgar specifically as corporate symbol. Chen rushes in defending Edgar, grapples with Darius. Wall shimmers where they hit. Darius shoves Chen into dissolving wall - he screams, back and side eaten away. Floor dissolution activates.

FADE IN:

INT. ROOT CUBE - LARGE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Main team already in the room: ALEX, MARCUS, EDGAR, LEA, JOSH, MORRIS, NINA, YUKI, CHEN. Nine people, exhausted. Catching their breath.

DARIUS enters through a doorway. Alone. Two heavy backpacks weighing him down.

Both groups freeze. See each other.

DARIUS stops. Bitter smile.

                    DARIUS
          You're still alive.

ALEX steps forward.

                    ALEX
          No thanks to you.

JOSH's eyes dart around - floor, walls, patterns shifting.

                    JOSH
               (quiet, uneasy)
          This room is wrong.

No one listens. All eyes on DARIUS.

YUKI suddenly steps forward. Breaking from the group.

                    YUKI
          Darius.

ALEX turns sharply.

                    ALEX
          Yuki, no—

YUKI's voice cracks.

                    YUKI
          You were right.

Silence. The words land like a bomb.

                    YUKI (CONT'D)
          The probability of escape is too low.
          We keep losing people.

NINA moves forward, joining Yuki.

                    NINA
          She's right. Rashid, Sofia... who's
          next?

MORRIS shifts uncomfortably. Looking between Alex and the others.

YUKI to Darius.

                    YUKI
          We want to come with you.

NINA nods.

                    NINA
          Find somewhere to survive. Stop
          chasing the exit that doesn't exist.

ALEX looks at MORRIS - sees him wavering.

                    ALEX
               (quietly)
          Morris?

MORRIS can't meet her eyes.

                    MORRIS
          I... the probability like Yuki said...
          I don't want to be... statistically...

He steps forward quickly. Joins Yuki and Nina.

                    MORRIS (CONT'D)
               (barely audible)
          I'm sorry, Alex.

ALEX's face - heartbreak. But she doesn't stop them.

DARIUS nods.

                    DARIUS
          Smart choice.

YUKI, NINA, and MORRIS cross to Darius's side.

DARIUS looks at the remaining main team. Five left with him now.

                    DARIUS (CONT'D)
          We'll need more supplies. Food, water,
          equipment.

EDGAR steps forward.

                    EDGAR
          No. You already took enough when you
          left.

MARCUS steps beside Edgar.

                    MARCUS
          You made your choice. Those supplies
          stay with us.

DARIUS brandishes a CROWBAR.

JOSH steps forward.

                    JOSH
          Don't. This room is wrong. The floor—

Both groups ignore Josh. Focused on each other.

DARIUS's rage focuses on one target. EDGAR.

                    DARIUS
          This is all your fault. The cube, the
          deaths, everything. You and your
          corporate masters.

EDGAR confused.

                    EDGAR
          What? I'm trying to help—

DARIUS LUNGES at Edgar specifically.

EDGAR stumbles back, hands up.

DARIUS grabs Edgar by the collar. SLAMS him against the wall.

                    EDGAR (CONT'D)
               (choking)
          Stop— we can— talk about this—

CHEN rushes in. Grabs Darius's arm.

                    CHEN
          Get off him!

CHEN yanks Darius away. They grapple. Crash into the wall.

The wall pattern begins to SHIMMER where they hit.

CHEN slams Darius back.

                    CHEN (CONT'D)
          He's trying to help! We're all trying
          to help!

DARIUS swings the crowbar. Catches Chen in the ribs.

CHEN gasps. Staggers.

The wall SHIMMERS more visibly.

LEA sees it.

                    LEA
          The wall—!

DARIUS shoves Chen hard.

Chen stumbles backward toward the shimmering wall.

ALEX screams.

                    ALEX
          CHEN, NO—!

CHEN's back HITS the dissolving wall section.

He SCREAMS. Dissolve burns spread across his back and side.

Falls to his knees.

Both groups freeze in horror.

JOSH looks at the floor.

                    JOSH
          The room— it's starting—

Floor tiles begin CHANGING COLOR. White to glowing chemical sheen.

JOSH shouts.

                    JOSH (CONT'D)
          THE FLOOR! GET OUT!

The dissolution pattern spreads across floor tiles in waves.

Fighting stops instantly. Survival overrides everything.

CHEN collapses. MARCUS moves to him.

                    MARCUS
          Chen! Hold on!

Grabs Chen. Starts dragging him toward exit.

ALEX helps. They pull Chen between them.

Floor tiles transforming. Safe gray tiles shrinking rapidly.

EDGAR calling out, calculating.

                    EDGAR
          There! That tile's still white! Step
          there!

Both groups scramble. Navigating shrinking safe surfaces.

MORRIS steps on a tile as it activates.

                    MORRIS
          Ah—!

His shoe dissolves. YUKI grabs him. Yanks him to safe tile.

ALEX and MARCUS drag Chen between them. Stepping carefully.

MARCUS steps on activating tile. Boot corrodes.

                    MARCUS
          Shit—!

Jerks foot back. Dissolve burn through boot to ankle. Gasps in pain.

DARIUS steps wrong. Foot through dissolving tile.

He SCREAMS. Pulls free. Deep burns on calf.

NINA grabs him. Helps him limp forward.

                    NINA
          Darius!

TWO EXITS visible - one on each side.

Groups split by proximity. Corrosive floor between them.

DARIUS's group - Darius, Morris, Nina, Yuki - reaches their exit. Darius limping badly.

MORRIS looks back at main team. Guilt on his face.

Main team - Alex, Marcus, Edgar, Josh, Lea - drags CHEN toward other exit.

For one moment, DARIUS and ALEX lock eyes across the room.

DARIUS sees them dragging Chen. Horror and guilt flash across his face.

ALEX sees Darius's burned leg. Everyone paying the price.

No words. Just acknowledgment.

Both groups exit through their doors.

Behind them, entire floor glows with dissolution.

INT. ROOT CUBE - NEXT ROOM (MAIN TEAM) - CONTINUOUS

Door closes. Alex and Marcus lower Chen to floor.

CHEN gasps. Dissolve burns catastrophic. Back and side eaten away.

ALEX kneels beside him. Helpless.

CHEN's breathing shallow. Rattling.

MARCUS stands over them. Face grim.

EDGAR against wall. Shaking. Chen died defending him.

LEA with hand on Alex's shoulder. Quiet grief.

JOSH from corner, cryptic.

                    JOSH
          Loyalty. The cube punishes it too.

CHEN's eyes find Edgar. No accusation. Just fading awareness.

His breathing rattles.

Then stops.

ALEX closes Chen's eyes.

                    ALEX
               (quiet)
          Rashid. Sofia. Now Chen.

MARCUS checks his ankle burn. Grimaces.

Only five left: Alex, Marcus, Edgar, Josh, Lea.

Stunned silence.

INT. ROOT CUBE - ESCAPE ROOM (DARIUS'S GROUP) - CONTINUOUS

DARIUS sits. Grimacing. Severe leg burns.

MORRIS beside him with shaking hands holds one of his shoes looking through a hole in the sole. Doesn't know what to do.

NINA and YUKI check each other for injuries. Both unharmed physically.

DARIUS stares at his leg. Processing what he just did.

MORRIS looks at Darius with new fear. Saw the violence.

NINA helps wrap Darius's leg.

DARIUS quiet. Haunted.

                    DARIUS
          We keep moving. Away from them.

Silence. Guilt and injuries.

INT. ROOT CUBE - NEXT ROOM (MAIN TEAM) - CONTINUOUS

ALEX stands. Looking at Chen's body.

JOSH from corner.

                    JOSH
          The cube makes you fight each other.
          Easier to kill you that way.

ALEX processes.

                    ALEX
          Darius attacked Edgar. Not Marcus.
          Not me. Edgar specifically.

EDGAR knows.

                    EDGAR
          Because I'm corporate. The
          face of the company to him. Even though my main job is delivering sof-tak. I don't decide who goes in there. And a lot of this info was not passed up the chain somehow.

MARCUS tests his burned ankle. Grimaces.

                    MARCUS
          Take it up with INZO. Need to know. No need to synergize.

                    EDGAR(annoyed)
          Shitter-gize. Fucking INZO.

                    MARCUS
          If we see Darius again?

ALEX decides.

                    ALEX
          We don't engage. We defend ourselves
          if we must. But we don't hunt them.

EDGAR still shaking.

                    EDGAR
          Chen died defending me from Darius.
          We can't let that pattern repeat.

ALEX firm.

                    ALEX
          The cube is the enemy. Not them. No
          matter what Darius thinks.

MARCUS limps toward next door.

Only five now: Alex, Marcus, Edgar, Josh, Lea.

JOSH leads them.

                    JOSH
          The cube will try again. It always
          does.

They move into darkness. Smaller. Weaker.

FADE OUT.
