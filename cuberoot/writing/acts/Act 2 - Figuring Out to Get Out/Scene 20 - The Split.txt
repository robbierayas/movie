SCENE 10 - THE SPLIT
=====================

LOCATION: Root cube location after Edgar's death - relatively safe room

CHARACTERS:
- Remaining 4 team members: Alex, Marcus, Josh, Lea
- After split: Marcus goes alone (1), Alex's group has Alex, Josh, Lea (3)

SCENE LAYOUT:

1. EXHAUSTION POINT
   - Only four left after Edgar's death: Alex, Marcus, Josh, Lea
   - Sitting in relatively safe room, exhausted
   - Marcus limping from ankle injury (Scene 8)
   - Alex staring at nothing - lost Morris, Nina, Yuki, Chen, Edgar
   - Alex: "We keep moving. Find others. Learn about this place."
   - Marcus: "For what? To watch them die too? Rashid, Sofia, Chen, Edgar..."
   - Tension building - different approaches to survival
   - Josh quiet in corner, watching the conflict develop
   - Lea between Alex and Marcus, sensing the divide

2. MARCUS'S ARGUMENT
   - Marcus stands despite ankle pain: "We have communication equipment. Measurement tools. We can BUILD something."
   - "Use the tech. Create a signal. Force a way out."
   - "Stop wandering and start engineering our escape."
   - Technical, pragmatic, immediate approach
   - Frustrated by all the losses: "I'm tired of watching people die while we explore."
   - "Chen understood this. He would have helped me build something."
   - Lea listening, conflicted
   - Josh watching silently

3. ALEX'S COUNTER
   - Alex: "And broadcast to who? We don't understand this place."
   - "We need information. We need to find others like Josh. Learn from survivors."
   - "Rushing in with tech is what INZO did. Look where that got us."
   - Exploratory, patient, communicative
   - "Morris trusted me to find answers, not force solutions."
   - "Edgar died because we didn't know. Knowledge saves lives."
   - Lea sees both sides - torn between approaches
   - Philosophical divide clear between Alex and Marcus

4. THE DEBATE
   - Marcus: "Every hour we wander, we lose supplies. Lose people. We're down to FOUR."
   - Alex: "Every shortcut costs us understanding. Edgar died because we didn't know about magnetic fields."
   - Marcus: "Edgar died because we didn't use our resources to escape when we had the chance."
   - Alex: "There is no escape without knowledge. Josh survived by learning the cube."
   - Josh from corner: "Both paths lead somewhere. Neither guaranteed."
   - Marcus to Josh: "You survived alone. I can too."
   - Alex to Josh: "You survived by moving, learning. That's what we're doing."
   - Josh: "Barry moved too. I survived. Barry didn't. The cube doesn't care which method you choose."
   - Unhelpful, but true

5. LEA'S POSITION
   - Both look to Lea - she's the tie-breaker between them
   - Marcus: "Lea, you're the physicist. Technical solution makes sense."
   - Alex: "Lea, you want to find Josh. You did. We kept moving. We need to explore."
   - Lea torn, looking between them: "I... I see both sides."
   - Marcus: "Choose. We need a decision."
   - Lea: "I can't. You're both right. You're both wrong."
   - "Josh survived by moving. But you're talking about building something."
   - Frustrated, emotional: "I won't split you up by choosing. I can't lose anyone else."
   - To Marcus: "Your way makes sense." To Alex: "So does yours."
   - "Figure it out together."

6. THE SPLIT DECISION
   - Marcus: "There is no together anymore. I'm taking equipment and building an exit."
   - Alex: "And I'm continuing to explore, find survivors, learn."
   - Stalemate - neither will budge
   - Marcus limps to backpacks: "Then we split the gear. You take what you need. I take what I need."
   - Alex: "Four people, two approaches."
   - Marcus: "You and Lea explore. Josh guides you. I work alone."
   - Alex: "Marcus, you're injured. You can't—"
   - Marcus: "I've made my decision. Have you made yours?"
   - Divide equipment:
     * Marcus takes: Technical equipment, communication devices, engineering tools
     * Alex/Lea/Josh keep: Supplies, measurement tools, navigation aids, sof-tak food

7. LEA AND JOSH'S CHOICE
   - Only Lea and Josh need to choose - Alex and Marcus already decided
   - Marcus looks at Lea and Josh: "Well?"
   - Josh stands: "I go where the movement goes. Alex keeps moving. I'll guide them."
   - Walks to stand with Alex
   - Everyone looks at Lea - final decision
   - Lea looks at Marcus: "Your approach makes sense. Technical, pragmatic."
   - Looks at Alex and Josh: "But Josh survived by moving. By learning."
   - Takes breath: "I'm not choosing between you, Marcus. But..."
   - Walks to Alex and Josh: "Someone needs to help them survive. Keep Josh focused."
   - Marcus nods, accepting: "So I work alone."
   - Alex: "Marcus, please. Don't do this alone."
   - Marcus: "Alone is safer. I won't watch anyone else die for my decisions."
   - Guilt over Sofia's death still heavy

8. THE DIVISION
   - Equipment split between Marcus and Alex's group
   - Tense but not hostile - mutual respect
   - Marcus packing technical gear into one backpack, limping
   - Lea helps him despite her choice: "Take the medical supplies for your ankle."
   - Marcus: "You'll need them more. Three of you exploring."
   - Alex to Marcus: "If you build an exit, signal us. We'll come."
   - Marcus to Alex: "If you find answers, I'll be listening on the comm channel."
   - Both mean it - not enemies, just different approaches
   - Lea to Marcus: "Don't die out there alone."
   - Marcus: "I've been carrying death since Sofia. Alone is better."
   - Josh to Marcus: "The cube likes division. Feeds on it. Be careful."
   - Marcus: "I'm always careful. It's everyone else who dies."
   - Guilt and pragmatism mixed in his voice

9. PARTING WORDS
   - Alex: "We started as two teams merged. Now we're barely a team at all."
   - Marcus: "Eleven people entered this cube. Now four are left, and we're splitting."
   - Alex: "Rashid, Sofia, Chen, Edgar... they're why we need to learn. Prevent more deaths."
   - Marcus: "They're why I need to build. Get out before there's no one left."
   - Mutual respect despite disagreement
   - Lea: "Edgar united us when we were trapped. Wish he was here to keep us together."
   - Moment of silence for Edgar - oblivious corporate fool who became leader
   - Alex: "He would tell us to work together."
   - Marcus: "He would. But he's dead. And I'm tired of losing people."
   - Must move forward - no changing minds now

10. SEPARATE PATHS
   - Marcus heads toward area Josh indicated had stable structure
     * Alone, limping on injured ankle
     * Plan to fortify position, build technical solution, engineer escape
     * Backpack full of equipment and tools
     * Determined, pragmatic, isolated
     * Guilt driving him: "I work alone. No one else dies for me."

   - Alex's group continues exploring deeper
     * Three of them: Alex, Lea, Josh
     * Josh guiding through cube's geometry
     * Lea providing dimensional expertise
     * Alex leading, determined to find survivors and information
     * Looking for understanding of the cube
     * Patient, exploratory, together

TONE: Exhausted frustration, philosophical debate, mutual respect despite disagreement, sad parting
CHARACTER DYNAMICS: Ideological split not betrayal, both sides have merit, Lea refuses to choose but goes with movement

END ACT 2:
- Team shattered: started with 11, down to 4, now split into 2 groups
- Marcus alone (1 person)
- Alex's group (3 people: Alex, Lea, Josh)
- Darius's group still out there (4 people: Darius, Morris, Nina, Yuki)
- Two philosophies: engineering escape vs. exploration for knowledge
- Neither approach is wrong - both valid
- Both trying to survive, just different methods
- Act 3 will determine which approach succeeds
- Or if both are necessary to escape

================================================================================

Description:
Marcus grows frustrated with the exploring approach. He wants to use their equipment to escape immediately - technical solution, now. Alex argues exploring is their only chance to communicate with others and gather the information they need to truly escape. Lea won't take a side but says it is how Josh survived - this becomes the core disagreement splitting the group. They divide the equipment between two approaches. Each character must decide which philosophy to follow: Marcus's pragmatic/technical approach vs Alex's exploratory/communicative approach. Scene ends with team divided into two groups. Second major betrayal/split - ideological rather than selfish.

Key Elements:
- Marcus's pragmatism vs Alex's exploration philosophy
- Ideological split, not selfish betrayal
- Lea refuses to choose - stays neutral
- Equipment divided
- Team splits based on belief
- Neither side is wrong
- Both approaches have merit
- End of Act 2 with divided team

Characters Present:
Remaining 4 team members: Alex, Marcus, Josh, Lea
After split: Marcus goes alone, Alex's group has Alex, Josh, Lea (3 members)

  - Guilt driving him: "I work alone. No one else dies for me."

- Alex's group continues exploring deeper
  - Three of them: Alex, Lea, Josh
  - Josh guiding through cube's geometry
  - Lea providing dimensional expertise
  - Alex leading, determined to find survivors and information
  - Looking for understanding of the cube
  - Patient, exploratory, together

END ACT 2:
- Team shattered: started with 11, down to 4, now split into 2 groups
- Marcus alone (1 person)
- Alex's group (3 people: Alex, Lea, Josh)
- Darius's group still out there (4 people: Darius, Morris, Nina, Yuki)
- Two philosophies: engineering escape vs. exploration for knowledge
- Neither approach is wrong - both valid
- Both trying to survive, just different methods
- Act 3 will determine which approach succeeds
- Or if both are necessary to escape

Character Moments:
- Marcus: Pragmatic, injured (ankle), frustrated with losses, guilt over Sofia drives him to work alone, wants immediate technical solution, refuses to watch anyone else die for his decisions
- Alex: Patient leader, believes understanding is key to survival, lost Morris/Nina/Yuki/Chen/Edgar but still committed to exploration, wants to learn from cube and find survivors
- Lea: Torn between both approaches, sees merit in each, refuses to choose sides but goes with Alex to help Josh, can't lose anyone else, emotional but rational
- Josh: Follows movement (exploration), warns division feeds the cube, cryptic but helpful, guides Alex's group, survived alone but joins them

Establishes:
- Ideological split: Marcus vs Alex
- Marcus ALONE: engineering escape, technical approach, injured and isolated, guilt-driven
- Alex's Group (3): Alex, Lea, Josh - gathering information, exploratory approach
- Both approaches have merit - neither is wrong
- Not betrayal like Darius - philosophical difference based on survival strategy
- Groups may reunite if either approach works
- Lea's refusal to choose shows wisdom - both sides valid
- Team utterly shattered: 11 started, 4 left, now split 1 and 3
- Marcus's guilt over Sofia's death driving his isolation

Final Team Status Entering Act 3:
- Marcus: ALONE (1 person) - technical/engineering approach
- Alex's Group: 3 people (Alex, Lea, Josh) - exploratory approach
- Darius's Group: 4 people (Darius, Morris, Nina, Yuki) - survival/farming approach
- Total survivors: 8 of original 11 (Rashid, Sofia, Chen, Edgar dead)
- Three separate groups with three different philosophies

Tone:
- Exhausted frustration
- Philosophical debate
- Mutual respect despite disagreement
- Sad parting
- Determination on both sides
- Uncertainty about future
- Hope that one approach works

SCREENPLAY
================================================================================

FADE IN:

INT. ROOT CUBE - RELATIVELY SAFE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Only four remaining. ALEX sits against one wall, staring at nothing. MARCUS leans opposite, limping ankle extended. JOSH watches from corner. LEA between them all.

Exhaustion. Loss. Seven dead.

                    ALEX
          We keep moving. Find others. Learn
          about this place.

MARCUS bitter laugh.

                    MARCUS
          For what? Watch them die too? Rashid,
          Sofia, Chen, Edgar...

Tension building. JOSH silent observer. LEA senses divide.

MARCUS stands despite ankle pain.

                    MARCUS (CONT'D)
          We have communication equipment.
          Measurement tools. We can BUILD
          something.
               (frustrated)
          Use the tech. Create a signal. Force
          a way out. Stop wandering and start
          engineering our escape.

                    MARCUS (CONT'D)
          I'm tired of watching people die
          while we explore.

ALEX firm.

                    ALEX
          And broadcast to who? We don't
          understand this place.
               (patient)
          We need information. Find others
          like Josh. Learn from survivors.

                    ALEX (CONT'D)
          Rushing in with tech is what INZO
          did. Look where that got us.

MARCUS sharp.

                    MARCUS
          Every hour we wander, we lose
          supplies. Lose people. We're down
          to FOUR.

                    ALEX
          Every shortcut costs us understanding.
          Edgar died because we didn't know
          about magnetic fields.

                    MARCUS
          Edgar died because we didn't use our
          resources to escape when we had the
          chance.

                    ALEX
          There is no escape without knowledge.
          Josh survived by learning the cube.

JOSH from corner, matter-of-fact.

                    JOSH
          Both paths lead somewhere. Neither
          guaranteed.

MARCUS to JOSH.

                    MARCUS
          You survived alone. I can too.

ALEX to JOSH.

                    ALEX
          You survived by moving, learning.
          That's what we're doing.

JOSH cryptic but true.

                    JOSH
          I survived. Barry didn't.
               (pause)
          The cube doesn't care which method
          you choose.

Both look to LEA. She's the tie-breaker.

MARCUS pleading.

                    MARCUS
          Lea, you're the physicist. Technical
          solution makes sense.

ALEX earnest.

                    ALEX
          Lea, you wanted to find Josh. You
          did. We kept moving. We need to
          explore.

LEA torn, looking between them.

                    LEA
          I... I see both sides.

MARCUS pressing.

                    MARCUS
          Choose. We need a decision.

LEA frustrated, voice tight.

                    LEA
          I can't. You're both right. You're
          both wrong.
               (desperate)
          Josh survived by moving. But you're
          talking about building something.

                    LEA (CONT'D)
          I won't split you up by choosing.
          I can't lose anyone else.

To MARCUS.

                    LEA (CONT'D)
          Your way makes sense.

To ALEX.

                    LEA (CONT'D)
          So does yours. Figure it out together.

MARCUS final.

                    MARCUS
          There is no together anymore. I'm
          taking equipment and building an exit.

ALEX equally final.

                    ALEX
          And I'm continuing to explore, find
          survivors, learn.

Stalemate. Neither budges.

MARCUS limps to backpacks.

                    MARCUS
          Then we split the gear. You take
          what you need. I take what I need.

                    ALEX
          Four people, two approaches.

MARCUS dividing equipment.

                    MARCUS
          You and Lea explore. Josh guides you.
          I work alone.

ALEX concerned.

                    ALEX
          Marcus, you're injured. You can't—

MARCUS cutting her off.

                    MARCUS
          I've made my decision. Have you made
          yours?

They divide equipment. Marcus takes technical gear, communication devices, engineering tools. Alex/Lea/Josh keep supplies, measurement tools, navigation aids, food.

Takes breath.

                    LEA
          I'm not choosing against you, Marcus.
          But... someone needs to help them
          survive. Keep Josh focused.

Walks to ALEX and JOSH.

MARCUS nods, accepting.

                    MARCUS
          So I work alone.

ALEX pleading.

                    ALEX
          Marcus, please. Don't do this alone.

MARCUS resolute, haunted.

                    MARCUS
          Alone is safer. I won't watch anyone
          else die for my decisions.

Guilt over Sofia heavy in his voice.

Equipment split. Tense but not hostile. Mutual respect.

MARCUS packs technical gear, limping. LEA helps despite her choice.

                    LEA
          Take the medical supplies for your
          ankle.

MARCUS refusing.

                    MARCUS
          You'll need them more. Three of you
          exploring.

ALEX to MARCUS.

                    ALEX
          If you build an exit, signal us.
          We'll come.

MARCUS to ALEX.

                    MARCUS
          Same to you.

Both mean it. Not enemies. Different approaches.

LEA to MARCUS.

                    LEA
          Don't die out there alone.

MARCUS bitter, haunted.

                    MARCUS
          I've been carrying death since Sofia.
          Alone is better.

JOSH to MARCUS, cryptic warning.

                    JOSH
          I was alone in here a long time. Be careful.

MARCUS bitter.

                    MARCUS
          I'm always careful. It's everyone
          else who dies.

ALEX sad.

                    ALEX
          We started as two teams merged. Now
          we're barely a team at all.

MARCUS countering.

                    MARCUS
          They're why I need to build. Get out
          before there's no one left.

Mutual respect despite disagreement.

ALEX, LEA, and JOSH move together towards door.

Team utterly shattered.

Eleven started. Four left. Now split into one and three.

MARCUS's guilt over Sofia driving his isolation.

Both trying to survive. Just different methods.

END OF ACT 2

FADE OUT.
