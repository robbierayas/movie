CHARACTER DYNAMICS: Edgar's heroic arc cut short, team reduced to four, infinite cube system revealed

================================================================================

Description:
Edgar enters metallic room first, team follows with Lea entering last. Josh warns "Metal. Too much metal." Subtle magnetic hum begins - Edgar feels strange pull at his hips, asks "Did anyone else feel that?" but doesn't understand what it is yet. Alex's watch twitches, Lea's earrings move. Marcus identifies weak magnetic field. Hum fades but Edgar still feels odd pull. Stronger pulse - Lea's earrings pull sharply to ceiling, she removes them, Alex removes watch. Marcus grabs backpacks with metal equipment and tosses them through doorway to next room. Stronger pulse hits Edgar - staggers, jerked violently, falls to knee. Reveals he has replacement metal hips. Massive pulse lifts Edgar off floor, slams him into ceiling screaming, then wall. Marcus tries to grab him but Edgar pulled away by magnetic field. Team helpless. Edgar pummeled ceiling-floor-wall brutally. Through the pain screams "Get out. Go." Team frozen, can't leave him. Edgar's body finally stops moving. Magnetic field drops, Edgar falls dead. Alex cradles him "No. No, Edgar..." Marcus closes his eyes. Lea notices magnetic field lines visible in air extending into distance - barely visible cubes, dozens, hundreds stretching to infinity. Josh: "The root cube is infinite. Cubes within cubes within cubes." All of them trapped here - past, present, future. Lea: "We can't save them all." Alex: "We save ourselves first. Then we try." Marcus broken by scope. Must leave Edgar's body. Team honors him - transformed from corporate fool to leader, stepped up when it mattered, earned his redemption. Four survivors continue: Alex, Marcus, Josh, Lea. Marcus limping on ankle injury. Leadership shared. Grief carried forward.

Key Elements:

FADE IN:

INT. ROOT CUBE - METALLIC ROOM - CONTINUOUS

EDGAR enters the metallic-looking room first. Walls shimmer with strange quality.

He steps forward cautiously.

ALEX, MARCUS, and JOSH follow him through the doorway.

JOSH immediately uneasy, eyes scanning walls.

                    JOSH
          Metal. Too much metal.

LEA enters last, still stepping through the doorway as the others spread out.

EDGAR looks around. Room seems empty. Safe.

                    EDGAR
          Maybe we can rest here.

JOSH firm.

                    JOSH
          No. Keep moving.

Subtle magnetic HUM begins - almost imperceptible.

EDGAR feels something. Strange pull at his hips. Face confused.

                    EDGAR
          Did anyone else feel that?

ALEX's watch twitches slightly on her wrist. She touches it.

                    ALEX
          Did you see that?

LEA's earrings move slightly toward ceiling. She notices.

MARCUS checking equipment, readings spiking.

                    MARCUS
          Magnetic field. Weak.

ALEX looks at the shimmering walls. Concern growing.

                    ALEX
          Should we leave?

The hum fades.

EDGAR touches his hip, uncertain. Still feels odd pull but doesn't understand what it is.

Magnetic pulse again - STRONGER.

LEA's earrings pull sharply toward ceiling. She yelps, removes them quickly.

                    LEA
          Ah—!

ALEX removes watch fast.

MARCUS's belt buckle straining. Equipment in backpacks rattling.

MARCUS urgent.

                    MARCUS
          We need to go. Now.

MARCUS grabs the backpacks - metal equipment rattling inside.

Carries them to the exit doorway. Tosses them through into next room.

Team moving toward exit.

Stronger pulse hits.

EDGAR staggers. Cries out.

                    EDGAR
          What—

Team looks at him.

Another pulse. EDGAR jerked violently to the side.

Falls to one knee.

                    EDGAR (CONT'D)
               (gasping)
          My hips. I have... metal hips.
          Replacement.

Horror dawns on team's faces.

LEA desperate.

                    LEA
          We have to get him out!

MASSIVE PULSE activates.

EDGAR LIFTED OFF FLOOR toward ceiling. Magnetic force pulling metal hips.

SLAMS into ceiling. SCREAMING.

                    EDGAR
          Ahhh—!

Falls partway. Another pulse - SLAMMED into wall.

Team trying to reach him.

MARCUS trying to grab him - Edgar pulled away by magnetic field strength.

                    MARCUS
          Edgar!

EDGAR pulled ceiling to floor to wall. Brutal. Violent. Unstoppable.

ALEX screaming his name.

                    ALEX
          Edgar! No!

LEA calculating angles - can't find safe approach. Tears in her eyes.

JOSH watching, cryptic.

                    JOSH
          The trap is the room. Can't stop it.

EDGAR'S body slammed repeatedly - ceiling, wall, floor.

Through the pain, EDGAR screams to them.

                    EDGAR
               (screaming)
          Get out. Go.

Team frozen. Can't leave him. Watching in horror.

EDGAR'S body continues pummeling - ceiling to floor to wall.

Finally stops moving.

Magnetic field DROPS.

EDGAR's body falls to floor. Broken. Dead.

Team rushes to him.

ALEX cradling him. Hands shaking.

                    ALEX
               (voice breaking)
          No. No, Edgar...

MARCUS closes EDGAR's eyes. Face grim.

Moment of silence.

The leader who transformed from fool to hero - gone.

LEA wipes tears. Then notices something.

                    LEA
          Look. The magnetic field...

Visible in air now - faint LINES.

Lines of magnetic force extending into distance.

Following the lines with eyes - can see barely visible CUBES.

Dozens. Hundreds. Stretching away into infinity.

                    LEA (CONT'D)
               (quiet shock)
          Those are... other cubes?

JOSH cryptic as always.

                    JOSH
          You thought this was only one. The
          root cube is infinite. Cubes within
          cubes within cubes.

Team staring at endless cubes stretching into the distance.

Each one potentially holding people.

MARCUS devastated. Limping on injured ankle.

                    MARCUS
          How many are trapped here?

JOSH haunting.

                    JOSH
          All of them. Everyone INZO sent.
          Everyone the cube pulled in. Past,
          present, future. All here.

LEA overwhelmed by the scope.

                    LEA
          We can't save them all.

ALEX finding strength. Has to lead now.

                    ALEX
          We save ourselves first. Then we try.

But the scope is overwhelming. Hundreds of cubes. Thousands of people potentially.

MARCUS broken.

                    MARCUS
          We're just... we're nothing in this.

ALEX firm. Won't give up.

                    ALEX
          We're alive. That's something.

Must leave EDGAR's body. Can't carry it.

ALEX stands. Looks down at Edgar one last time.

                    ALEX (CONT'D)
               (quiet)
          He would want us to keep moving.

MARCUS limping badly on injured ankle from Scene 8.

                    MARCUS
          He stepped up when it mattered.

Team acknowledges EDGAR - moment of silence.

Then continues toward next doorway.

Now 4 members: Alex, Marcus, Josh, Lea.

Leadership shared: Alex and Marcus. Lea supports. Josh guides.

MARCUS slowed significantly by ankle injury.

Grief carried forward. Scope of cube system haunting them all.

They move into the darkness. Smaller. Weaker. But still moving.

FADE OUT.
