TONE: Tension with comic relief, fear of separation, team bonding
VISUAL FOCUS: Morris's sneeze scare, door closing before Morris, cube mechanically rearranging, Morris appearing from ceiling door

================================================================================

Description:
Team follows Josh into the n=3 cube rooms. Morris absentmindedly walks through a door first without checking, causing a sneeze scare when the team thinks he triggered a trap. Marcus establishes authority over Morris as his new manager, warning him about life insurance payouts and following protocol. When a door closes before Morris can follow the group, the cube mechanically rearranges, separating them. The team searches frantically until Morris reappears from a ceiling door, revealing the cube's physical rearrangement system. Marcus shows vulnerability, admitting he's "not used to people dying." Darius questions Alex about blindly trusting Josh, beginning his company distrust arc. Comic relief via Morris's "Yes Boss" and Nina's "Dr. Schroedinger" joke. Team establishes buddy system and commits to trusting Josh's navigation despite not understanding it.

Key Elements:
- Morris absentmindedly volunteers to go first
- Sneeze scare - group thinks Morris triggered trap
- Marcus establishes authority over Morris with life insurance talk
- Door closes before Morris can follow group
- Cube mechanically rearranges, Morris disappears
- Team searches frantically for Morris
- Morris reappears from ceiling door - room was rearranged above them
- Josh unsurprised by the possibility even though he knows it is very rare; it just confirms cube is sentient to him
- Nina's "Dr. Schroedinger" joke - comic relief
- Marcus vs Josh argument about whose method got someone "killed"
- Darius' distrust of company begins
- Team commits to trusting Josh's navigation

Characters Present:
Alex, Edgar, Marcus, Lea, Morris, Darius, Nina, Chen, Rashid, Yuki, Josh (11 people)
Sofia is missing - left in Act 1, Scene 9, location unknown


Character Moments:
- Morris: Absentmindedly volunteers without thinking, sneeze scare, takes in Marcus's warning seriously, reappears with "Yes Boss" quip
- Marcus: Establishes authority over Morris as "new manager," responsible for life insurance payouts, argues Josh's method got someone killed, exasperated by strangeness
- Josh: Unsurprised by cube mechanics, calm in chaos, proves knowledgeable; "Who was killed?" demonstrates lucidity by engaging directly with Marcus's accusation while maintaining semi-threatening calm (similar to "The cube will teach you. Painfully" - shows he understands their doubt AND knows more than them)
- Lea: Suggests taking turns for safety
- Edgar: Volunteers to go through next room to get it over with, pairs with Darius in buddy system
- Alex: Keeps team together during search, manages panic
- Darius: Distrust of company begins (not just paranoia), mutters to himself about leaders pretending to have control
- Nina: Comic relief with "Dr. Schroedinger I presume" joke
- Chen: Focused on understanding mechanics
- Rashid/Yuki: Background support during search, join in Schroedinger joke

Establishes:
- Cube mechanically rearranges entire rooms when doors close
- Easy to get separated - dangerous
- Morris's room moved to ceiling location above team
- Josh understands the cube mechanics intuitively
- Marcus's authority over Morris as new manager
- Marcus responsible for Morris's safety (and life insurance)
- Darius beginning to distrust the company
- Team capable of humor even in danger (Nina's Schroedinger joke)
- Marcus skeptical of Josh's methods but has no alternative
- Team commits to following Josh's navigation despite not understanding it
- Taking turns entering rooms for safety
- No traps in these 4 rooms

Technical Notes:
- 4 total rooms, no traps
- Rooms are identical - 6 faces, 6 doors, ladder rungs
- Mechanical rearrangement system physically moves rooms
- Morris's room relocated to ceiling position above team
- Sneeze scare moment: Morris arched strangely before sneezing
- Marcus-Morris dynamic: manager/employee, life insurance responsibility
- Darius arc begins: company distrust (not paranoia)
- Comedy beats: Morris's sneeze, "Yes Boss", Nina's "Dr. Schroedinger I presume"
- Marcus vs Josh tension: skepticism vs intuitive knowledge

Tone:
- Tension with comic relief (sneeze scare, Schroedinger joke)
- Fear of separation when Morris disappears
- Relief when Morris reappears safely
- Marcus's authority establishing (serious life insurance talk)
- Team bonding through shared danger
- Growing trust in Josh despite not understanding him
- Darius's darker turn beginning (company distrust)

FADE IN:

INT. ROOT CUBE - ROOM 2 (JOSH'S ROOM) - CONTINUOUS

The team clusters near a door. JOSH stands at the threshold, peering through.

ALEX checks her team - eleven people, tense. Sofia still missing.

                    LEA
          We should take turns. Check each room
          before everyone goes through.

Team nods agreement. Safer that way.

MORRIS, distracted, steps past JOSH without thinking.

                    MORRIS
          Right, that makes sense—

He walks straight through the door.

Team FREEZES. Shocked.

ALEX rushes to doorway, looks in.

INT. ROOT CUBE - ROOM 3 - CONTINUOUS

ANGLE - THROUGH DOORWAY

MORRIS standing in next room. Face contorted, head arched back strangely, back bent.

ANGLE - TEAM'S FACES (in Room 2 doorway)

Terror. Morris triggered something.

ANGLE - MORRIS (in Room 3)

SNEEZES.

Straightens up, rubbing his nose.

Team EXHALES. Relief flooding through them.

They file in quickly, surrounding Morris in Room 3.

                    ALEX
               (firm but not angry)
          Morris. We check first. Always.

                    MORRIS
          I... sorry, I thought—
               (confused)
          It isn't obvious when they're safe?

                    JOSH
               (cryptic)
          Nothing obvious. The cube deceives.

EDGAR steps forward, decisive.

                    EDGAR
          I'll go through the next one. Get it
          out of the way.

MARCUS moves to block MORRIS as he starts toward the next door. DARIUS flanks him.

                    MARCUS
          Morris. Hold on.

MORRIS stops. Uncertain.

                    MARCUS (CONT'D)
          I don't know you well. But you're on
          my team now. Quantum Logistics.

                    MORRIS
          I... yes. Thank you?

                    MARCUS
          As your manager, I'm responsible for you.
          That means making sure you get home safe.
               (beat, direct)
          And making sure life insurance payouts
          go out when you don't.

MORRIS stares.

                    MARCUS (CONT'D)
          You need to do what I say. Follow protocol. (pause)
          Or you'll wind up dead.

Beat. MORRIS processing. The weight of it.

                    MORRIS
               (quiet)
          I understand.

EDGAR and DARIUS move through the next door. CHEN, RASHID, YUKI follow.

NINA and LEA exchange looks, then go through.

ALEX gestures JOSH forward. He goes.

MARCUS follows.

MORRIS hangs back, last. Approaches the door.

The door SLIDES CLOSED.

MORRIS lunges—

Too late. Door SHUTS in his face.

                    MORRIS
               (muffled, panicked)
          Wait!

INT. ROOT CUBE - ROOM 4 - CONTINUOUS

Team turns. Door closed behind them, Morris trapped in Room 3.

MECHANICAL SOUND. Deep in the walls.

                    ALEX
          Morris!

She rushes to the door. Won't open.

                    MORRIS (O.S.)
               (muffled)
          Hello? I can hear you!

Team panics. EDGAR and CHEN try other doors - all locked.

                    MARCUS
               (to Josh)
          Can you—?

                    JOSH
               (calm, ominous)
          Wait. It's deciding.

                    ALEX
          Deciding what?!

                    MORRIS (O.S.)
               (scared, rambling)
          I can— I hear you but I don't— is there
          another door? Do I try another door?

LEA presses against the closed door.

                    LEA
          Stay there! Don't move!

DARIUS gives concerned look to MARCUS who looks guilty but helpless.

Subtle sound - MECHANICAL, distant. Growing.

JOSH tenses.

Noise momentarily becomes much louder as room SHUDDERS slightly. Mechanical grinding.

Everyone grabs walls, equipment, each other.

The sound FADES.

JOSH moves to a different door. Places hand on it.

                    JOSH (CONT'D)
               (cryptic)
          Cube rearranges when doors close. Rooms move.

The door under his hand OPENS.

Chen rushes to look into Room 3. 6 faces, 6 doors.

Empty. Morris is not here.

                    YUKI
          Where is he?

                    CHEN
          He was just behind us.

LEA voice tired.

                    LEA
          We lost someone already.

                    ALEX
               (firm, leadership)
          We didn't lose him. He's here. Somewhere.

                    EDGAR
          Visual contact. Everyone stays where I
          can see you. No one else gets separated.

Team clusters tighter. Eyeing all six doors warily.

Mechanical sounds - distant, around them. Rooms being shuffled.

CHEN examines walls, ceiling, floor.

                    CHEN
          It's mechanical. Physical rearrangement.
          If we can map the pattern—

                    JOSH
               (interrupting)
          No pattern you can learn. The cube adapts.

LEA to JOSH, urgent.

                    LEA
          Josh, can you find him? The way you
          navigate—

                    JOSH
               (cryptic)
          He's already where he needs to be.

MARCUS, frustration building, turns on JOSH.

                    MARCUS
          Your method just got someone killed!

Beat.

JOSH tilts head. Confused.

                    JOSH
          Who was killed?

MARCUS exasperated, voice rising.

                    MARCUS
          What do you mean? (Yells) Morris! We lost—

CEILING DOOR OPENS above them.

Everyone looks up.

MORRIS's face appears in the opening. Upside-down from their perspective.

                    MORRIS
               (uncertain, awkward)
          Yes boss?

Beat.

TEAM stares.

JOSH, unsurprised, nods slightly.

LEA exhales. Relief washing over her.

NINA, grinning despite herself.

                    NINA
          Dr. Schroedinger, I presume?

Beat.

MORRIS blinks. Gets it. Smiles uncertainly.

YUKI laughs - tension breaking.

                    YUKI
          Alive and dead-

RASHID joins in.

                    RASHID
          -until he opened the door.

Team laughs. Relief, exhaustion, absurdity of it all.

MARCUS studies JOSH. Reassessing.

                    MARCUS
               (measured)
          You knew.

                    JOSH
          I warned you.

                    MARCUS
          But how?

                    JOSH
               (cryptic)
          Because he kept moving. In his mind.
          It's fairly simple, but we don't have time.

                    MARCUS
          Enough moving! I'm not used to people dying in front of me. We should have stayed at the lab and you would have shown up and we
          could have shrunk you down and we could have solved it from there.

LEA and ALEX sympathetic as this is first sign of unease from MARCUS. LEA to MARCUS and the group.

                    LEA
          We need to trust Josh. He understands
          this place.

ALEX nods agreement. DARIUS pulls ALEX aside.

                    DARIUS
          I know it's been safe so far, but the odds are against us if we keep moving.

                    ALEX
          Staying in the lab wasn't an option. There was no power.

ALEX pauses knowing next part may sound ridiculous.

                    ALEX
          And- and isn't it weird the moment we leave the building Josh comes in the room? I- I mean if the cube is effecting randomness, maybe this sign is our way out.

DARIUS, quiet anger simmering, questions ALEX.

                    DARIUS
               (quiet, bitter)
          You believe what he said?

                    ALEX
          Darius-

                    DARIUS
               (quiet, bitter)
          You'd put our lives in his hands?

                    ALEX
          It's a rock and a hard place. If we stay put, we run out of water soon. If we stay ALIVE, maybe the
          company sends us a care package and a rescue mission. We aren't physicists. We have to trust them.

                    DARIUS
          Blindly.

MARCUS organizes.

                    MARCUS
          Fine. Buddy system. Everyone pair up.
          Morris with me.

MORRIS looks surprised. Grateful.

                    EDGAR
          Nina and Yuki. Rashid and Chen.
          Darius with me.

ALEX finishes.

                    ALEX
          Lea with Josh. I'll stay mobile.

                    EDGAR
               (insisting)
          You stay in the middle.

JOSH moves toward next door. Team follows closer now. he reaches to open the door to the next room, but pauses
 1 inch away. when he continues, it lights up and he sighs even though the door opens, indicating he
 realizes it will be a trap room without saying anything at first.

                    JOSH
          Through. Keep moving.
               (pause, ominous)
          The cube is measuring you now.

Team exchanges nervous looks.

But they follow.

FADE OUT.
