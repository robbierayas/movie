FADE IN:

INT. QL BUILDING - LAB - DAWN

Harsh fluorescent lights hum overhead. Empty coffee cups litter the work tables. Equipment blinks and beeps, indifferent to the exhaustion.

Through the lab windows: impossible geometry. Cube walls where the parking lot should be. The morning light filtering through them casts wrong-angled shadows across the floor.

EDGAR stands at the whiteboard, tie loosened, sleeves rolled up to his elbows. The marker squeaks as he tallies numbers with corporate precision. His movements are deliberate, focused—something to control when everything else is chaos.

By the windows, ALEX and LEA stand shoulder to shoulder, faces reflected in the glass. Alex's arms are crossed tight. Lea presses one hand against the window, fingers spread.

                    ALEX
          Still there.

Lea's hand drops to her side.

                    LEA
          It's not going anywhere.

The rest of the team scattered around the lab like survivors of a shipwreck:

MORRIS slumps in an office chair, one leg bouncing with nervous energy.

DARIUS leans against the far wall, arms crossed, face unreadable. He watches the group but doesn't join it.

NINA, RASHID, and YUKI cluster around a work table covered in measurement devices, whispering calculations that don't add up.

CHEN methodically checks equipment batteries, testing each one twice.

Edgar caps the marker. Turns to face the room.

                    EDGAR
          Alright.

Heads turn toward him. Morris's leg stops bouncing.

                    EDGAR (CONT'D)
          Inventory. Compressed sof-tak—one hundred
          units. Water—nearly two cases. Figure
          fifteen bottles each, give or take.

Chen sets down a battery pack.

                    CHEN
          I separated what we actually need.
          Stripped it down. Not as much to carry.

Nina looks up from her calculations, marker still in hand.

                    NINA
          We don't even know if time passes
          normally here. Three weeks could be
          three months.
               (beat)
          Or three days.

The room goes quiet. The hum of the lights seems louder. Edgar's marker rolls off the whiteboard tray and hits the floor. No one picks it up.

Lea turns from the window, jaw set.

                    LEA
          We need to explore. Josh is out there.
          Barry too. We can't just sit here and—

                    YUKI
               (cutting in)
          We could stay. Board up the doors.
          Make this place defensible. Someone
          has to know we're missing by now.

Alex turns from the window. Her voice cuts through the hope.

                    ALEX
          No one's coming.

Darius pushes off the wall, uncrosses his arms.

                    DARIUS
          There's nowhere to come from.

Marcus takes a step forward, glancing between Edgar and the team.

                    MARCUS
          The only way here is through the
          transmitter. In the lab. Which is
          now...
               (gestures to the lab)
          here.

Edgar picks up the dropped marker. Sets it carefully on the tray.

                    EDGAR
          Then it's up to us.

Yuki's hands fidget with a measurement device. Her voice small:

                    YUKI
          What if we get lost?

Nina straightens, pushes her calculations aside.

                    NINA
          We can't abandon people. Josh. Barry.
          That's not who we are.

Chen crosses his arms, looking at the equipment spread before him.

                    CHEN
          Can we survive out there? What are
          we actually looking at? Percentage-wise?

Marcus's expression tightens—the question he's been avoiding. But he needs Edgar to see him as an ally. He steps into the center of the room.

                    MARCUS
          Staying here? That's slow death. Our
          supplies run out, we get no answers,
          we die anyway.
               (beat)
          Exploring gives us a chance. Find our
          people. Work with them. Maybe find a way out.

Lea nods, urgent.

                    LEA
          If we find Barry and Josh, we might
          have everything we need. Then we can
          come back. Regroup.

Yuki looks at Morris. Morris meets her eyes, manages a weak nod.

                    MORRIS
          We stay together. That's our best shot.

Yuki studies the faces around her. Slowly, she nods.

Alex steps away from the windows, moving to the center of the group. When she speaks, her voice is steady, scientific.

                    ALEX
          We move carefully. Strategically.
          We treat this like any other field
          experiment. No one rushes in blind.

Edgar looks around at his team. Makes the decision.

                    EDGAR
          Then let's do it. We'll be back before
          we know it.

The team exchanges looks. No one believes him. But they need to.

CUT TO:

INT. QL BUILDING - LOBBY - LATER

The team spreads across the lobby in small groups. Backpacks at their feet, being loaded with supplies. The mood is tense, focused.

Morris and Chen crouch near the reception desk, dividing measurement equipment into equal loads. Morris holds up each piece, Chen nods or shakes his head.

Nina, Rashid, and Yuki sit in a triangle on the floor near the elevator, discussing transportation protocols.

Darius stands alone by the windows, securing his pack. His movements efficient, practiced. He doesn't look at the others.

Near the exit door, Lea and Alex stand close, voices low.

                    LEA
               (quiet but fierce)
          We'll find them. Josh and Barry.
          We will.

Alex puts a hand on Lea's shoulder. Squeezes once.

                    ALEX
          I know.

Across the lobby, Edgar moves between groups, checking supplies, asking quiet questions. His tie is gone now. Sleeves still rolled up. He's transformed—no trace of the corporate VP who showed up to impress investors. This is someone who knows how to organize, how to lead, how to keep people alive.

He reaches the reception desk, watches Chen snap a case shut.

                    EDGAR
          Equipment distributed?

Chen hefts a backpack, tests the weight.

                    CHEN
          Even loads. Everyone has what they need.

Edgar nods. Moves to Nina's group, then to Darius. Each time: a question, a confirmation, a nod.

Finally, he returns to the center of the lobby. The team notices, falls quiet. They gather near the exit door, pulling on backpacks, adjusting straps.

Alex steps forward, looks at each face in turn. Morris. Nina. Chen. Rashid. Yuki. Darius. Lea. Marcus. Edgar.

                    ALEX
          Stay together. Stay alert.

She takes a breath.

                    ALEX (CONT'D)
          We find Josh. We find Barry.
          We find a way out.

Edgar stands beside her, jaw tight. Fear in his eyes. But his voice is steady.

                    EDGAR
          And we all come back.

Marcus steps to the door. His hand on the handle. He looks back at the team one last time.

Then he turns the handle. The door swings open.

Beyond the threshold: the root cube. Impossible angles. Walls that shouldn't exist. Light bending in ways light shouldn't bend.

The team stares into it. Nobody moves.

Then Lea takes the first step forward. Alex follows. One by one, the team files through.

Edgar goes last. He looks back at the lobby—safety, shelter, the known world—then steps through and pulls the door closed behind him.

The lobby is empty.

FADE OUT.
