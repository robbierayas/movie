NEW TRAP IDEAS FOR CUBE SEQUEL
========================================

SINGLE PERSON TRAPS
-------------------

1. Freezing Fog Trap (Act 3, Scene 24)
   - Door closes, trapping victims inside room
   - Freeze fog erupts from center bottom door at -200°C
   - Fog billows outward but dissipates to normal temperature against walls
   - Safe to navigate along walls, deadly in center
   - Victims freeze BACK to FRONT if caught in fog
   - Freezing happens while still moving - horrifying
   - Frozen bodies shatter on impact with floor/walls
   - Creates tactical challenge: must reach exit while avoiding center

2. Floor Dissolution Trap (Act 2, Scene 8)
   - Floor tiles change color from white to glowing chemical sheen
   - Dissolution spreads in wave pattern across room
   - Corrosive surface dissolves anything on contact
   - Safe tiles shrink rapidly - must navigate carefully
   - Wall sections also dissolve when impacted
   - Creates burn injuries on contact, fatal if prolonged
   - Forces groups to split to different exits

3. Pressure Differential Trap
   - Room rapidly depressurizes like airlock
   - Victim experiences explosive decompression
   - Blood boils, organs rupture
   - Silent and invisible danger

4. Chain Restraint Mathematical Lock Trap (Act 2, Scene 5)
   - Hidden pressure plate in floor triggers trap
   - Chains deploy from five corners of room
   - Grab victim by hands, ankles, and neck - suspended and restrained
   - Mathematical lock symbols glow on restraints
   - Must solve complex mathematical puzzle to unlock (thesis-level difficulty)
   - Floor tiles glow in sequence showing timer countdown
   - Requires multiple people calculating to solve in time
   - DEADLY: Trap reactivates without warning after "successful" unlock
   - Secondary mechanism - no timer restart on reactivation
   - Kills anyone who lingers to study the mechanism
   - Adaptive/learning trap behavior

5. Magnetic Pulse Trap (Act 2, Scene 9)
   - Metallic-looking room with strange shimmer on walls
   - Starts with subtle magnetic hum - weak field
   - Escalates in pulses: weak → medium → strong → extreme
   - Pulls on metal objects: jewelry, watches, belt buckles, equipment
   - DEADLY for people with metal implants (hip replacements, etc.)
   - Extreme pulses lift victim and pummel them: ceiling → wall → floor
   - Brutal, violent, unstoppable once activated
   - Team helpless to intervene - magnetic field too strong
   - Room looks ordinary until field activates

6. Sound Frequency Trap
   - Emits frequency that liquefies internal organs
   - Inaudible at first, then intensifies
   - Victim bleeds from eyes, ears, nose
   - No visible trap mechanism

7. Dimensional Slice Trap
   - Room exists in two dimensional states simultaneously
   - When victim moves through center, they're bisected
   - Clean cut through any point of body
   - Room appears to shimmer slightly

8. Oxygen Displacement Trap
   - Room fills with heavier-than-air invisible gas (CO2 or nitrogen)
   - Victim suffocates without realizing
   - Thinks they're just getting dizzy
   - No visible threat

9. Light Blade Trap
   - Concentrated laser grid activates at chest height
   - Beams are invisible until they hit matter
   - Cuts through victim when they move forward
   - Room may appear to have a faint shimmer

10. Cellular Disruption Trap / Microwave Trap (Act 2, Scene 5)
    - Microwave radiation at specific frequency
    - Victim feels it activate - knows what's coming
    - Door seals when activated - cannot escape
    - Boils water in victim's cells at cellular level
    - Skin reddens, breathing becomes gasps
    - Cooks victim from inside out over 20 seconds
    - Quiet death - too exhausted to scream
    - Room may feel slightly warm before activation
    - Trap remains active - room cannot be crossed after death

11. Temporal Loop Trap
    - Victim stuck in 10-second time loop
    - Relives same moment until they die of dehydration
    - From outside, victim appears frozen/glitching
    - Room has slight echo/reverb to sounds


MULTIPLE PERSON TRAPS
---------------------

1. Weight Threshold Trap
   - Requires two or more people's weight
   - Floor collapses into pit of spikes below
   - Safe for one person, deadly for groups
   - Encourages splitting up with deadly consequences

2. Air Separation Trap
   - Divides oxygen between all people in room
   - More people = less oxygen per person
   - Group suffocates together
   - Single person would have enough air

3. Chain Reaction Trap
   - First person triggers slow-acting mechanism
   - Second person accelerates it
   - Third person causes immediate activation
   - Walls close in crushing all occupants

4. Heat Redistribution Trap
   - Draws body heat from all occupants
   - Redistributes it to one random person
   - Some freeze while one burns from within
   - Larger group = more extreme temperatures

5. Fractal Mirror Trap
   - Mirrors on all surfaces create infinite reflections
   - Multiple people see infinite versions of each other
   - Drives victims to violent paranoia
   - Attack each other thinking they're duplicates/threats

6. Resonance Trap
   - Multiple heartbeats create destructive resonance
   - Sound waves amplify and shatter bones
   - Single heartbeat wouldn't trigger
   - More people = faster death


PSYCHOLOGICAL/DECEPTIVE TRAPS
------------------------------

1. False Exit Trap / Vacuum Trap (Act 2, Scene 7)
   - Room appears to have exit door leading outside
   - Door actually opens to void/vacuum of space
   - When opened, air rushes out violently with roaring sound
   - Victim sucked out into endless black void
   - Vacuum pulls through multiple connected rooms
   - Team members nearby nearly pulled through doorway
   - Door automatically closes when cube decides - doesn't slice anyone
   - Preys on hope of escape - "I think it's the exit!"
   - Door looks like it could be real exit

2. Sustenance Trap
   - Food and water appear in room
   - Both are laced with fast-acting poison
   - Targets desperate, dehydrated victims
   - Looks like a gift after days in the cube

3. Rescue Simulation Trap
   - Hologram/speaker system simulates rescue team
   - Directs victim to "safe extraction point"
   - Leads to lethal trap
   - Preys on hope and trust


DIMENSIONALLY-ADVANCED TRAPS (for hypercube areas)
---------------------------------------------------

1. Dimensional Transporter Trap (Act 1, Scene 0)
   - Silent activation - no warning, no sound
   - Stepping in center of room triggers trap
   - Fingertips begin dissolving and reappearing displaced (to victim's right)
   - Body parts exist in two places at once briefly
   - Effect spreads to all extremities: fingers, toes, hands, feet
   - Dissolves and reassembles in WRONG locations
   - Body parts impossibly separated in space
   - Victim conscious throughout 20-second death
   - Scared but doesn't scream - too alien to process
   - Not violent, not bloody - just fundamentally WRONG
   - Entire body torn apart "dimensionally"
   - Pieces exist in dozen impossible locations
   - Complete dissolution - victim gone
   - Room returns to normal, empty
   - Establishes cube's incomprehensible alien nature

2. 4D Compression Trap
   - Room folds through 4th dimension
   - Compresses 3D space into 2D
   - Victim is flattened but remains conscious briefly
   - Appears as walls moving impossibly

3. Quantum Superposition Trap
   - Victim exists in multiple states simultaneously
   - States collapse into deadliest outcome
   - Body parts exist in different positions at once
   - Room has reality distortion effect

4. Möbius Space Trap
   - Room's interior surface is Möbius strip
   - Gravity follows the surface
   - Victim walks in loop, eventually colliding with themselves
   - Collision is fatal due to dimensional stress

5. Probability Collapse Trap
   - All possible futures converge on victim's death
   - Impossible to avoid - every action leads to same end
   - Random objects become lethal through quantum effects
   - Room feels "wrong" but no obvious danger


PUZZLE/PATTERN TRAPS (Non-Lethal "Easy Mode")
----------------------------------------------

1. Fibonacci Floor Pattern (Timed Simon Says)
   - Floor grid with color-changing tiles
   - Door opens, first tile in front turns YELLOW (target)
   - Step on yellow → turns GREEN (active timer), next target turns YELLOW at RANDOM location
   - Step on second yellow → turns GREEN, first tile turns BLUE (safe/complete)
   - Timer mechanic: if you stay on GREEN too long, it shocks you (non-lethal)
   - Getting shocked RESETS entire sequence - all tiles return to white, start over
   - BLUE tiles are safe - no shock, can stand there BUT they slowly fade back to white
   - Pattern escalates following Fibonacci sequence:
     * First: 1 tile
     * Second: 2 tiles in sequence
     * Third: 3 tiles in sequence
     * Fourth: 5 tiles in sequence
     * Fifth: 8 tiles in sequence, etc.
   - ONE PERSON AT A TIME - can't tag team it
   - PATH IS RANDOM for each person - yellows appear at unpredictable locations
   - Could get lucky (short path close to door) or unlucky (long zigzag across room)
   - Must complete all tiles before first blues fade completely
   - Once complete, tiles reset for next person
   - EACH PERSON must complete their own random path - can't share/follow
   - Visual feedback is clear (color changes)
   - Punishing but not deadly - establishes cube can be "gentle"
   - Tests intelligence, speed, endurance, precision, AND luck (path randomness)


NOTES FOR TRAP DESIGN:
----------------------
- Best traps are non-obvious until activated
- Should maintain paranoia - victims never feel safe
- Mix of quick deaths and slow psychological torture
- Some traps should be avoidable with knowledge (rewards smart characters)
- Others should be completely unavoidable (maintains threat)
- Variation in trap types keeps audience engaged
- Consider how trap room looks vs. safe room (subtle differences)
- Early traps can be non-lethal to establish false sense of security
