## 1. CUBE MECHANICS REFERENCE

### Dimensional Terminology

The screenplay uses mathematical notation (n=X) for formal/technical contexts, but characters use colloquial terms in dialogue after Act 1, Scene 7 (when Marcus explains the concept to Edgar).

**Formal → Colloquial:**
- **n=0** → "singularity" (for a single cube shrunk to n=0) or "0-space" (for the space it exists in)
- **n=0.333** → "root-space" (referencing cube root)
- **n=1** → "1D"
- **n=2** → "2D"
- **n=3** → "3-space" or "3D"
- **n=4** → "hypercube" or "hyperspace"

**Usage in scenes:**
- Act 1, Scene 7: Edgar is confused and asks what the dimensional notation means; Marcus explains
- After Scene 7: Use colloquial terms in dialogue and informal narration
- Scene descriptions, technical explanations, and formal contexts can still use mathematical notation

### N=3 Cube Configuration
- 3×3×3 = 27 total cube rooms
- Each room has 6 equal-sized faces (floor, ceiling, 4 walls)
- Center of each face has a door to the next room
- 4 sets of ladder rungs per door, positioned 90° apart

### Visual Design
- Fractal-like tiles on blank wall spaces
- Tiles can change color when story requires it
- Walls do NOT shimmer or move (except the apparent shimmer of acid room)
- Walls emit light at normal brightness

### Door Mechanics
- Small square door located directly in the center of each cube face (not along the floor)
- Just big enough for a person with a backpack to crawl through
- No handle - doors open and close mechanically
- Doors can close and trap people
- When doors close, the cube mechanically rearranges entire rooms
- Rearrangement is physical, not dimensional
- Creates extreme disorientation through sameness and mechanical shuffling
- **In root-space:** When the cube rearranges, you're knocked off the orbital you were on - no pattern to follow, making every room potentially trapped
- 4 sets of ladder rungs positioned 90° apart around each door for climbing

### Important Note
There are no actual dimensional effects in the n=3 rooms themselves - just mechanical rearrangement of identical spaces. The team perceives impossible geometry but it's actually confusion from sameness.

## 2. ROOT CUBE SPECIFIC MECHANICS REFERENCE

### The Danger Zone Problem
The root-space cube contains areas of varying danger. The three nuclei are the danger zone centers - highly concentrated danger at these three points. Movement is NOT based on xyz spatial dimensions - you can't avoid danger by moving "left" or "right" in normal space. Instead, danger is based on dimensional saturation gradients that don't align with physical direction.

### How It Works (Pseudo-Science)
**The Three Nuclei:**
- Root-space has exactly three nuclei (danger zone centers)
- Each nucleus is a point of extreme danger and dimensional instability
- The three nuclei generate overlapping fields throughout root-space

**Orbital Shells (Safe Zones):**
- Orbital shells are safe zones at specific distances from the nuclei
- Like electron orbitals in atomic physics, these are shells based on distance from the nucleus
- Each nucleus generates its own set of orbital shells
- Being within an orbital shell = safe navigation
- Where orbital shells from different nuclei overlap = safest zones

**Dimensional Saturation Gradient:**
- The gradient is the change in danger as you move closer to a nucleus
- Higher concentration near the nuclei, dissipating as you move away
- Moving toward a nucleus = increasing danger
- Moving toward an orbital shell = decreasing danger
- The danger is dimensional, not spatial

**Non-Spatial Navigation:**
- You cannot navigate away from danger using xyz movement alone
- Moving through a door may bring you closer to or further from a nucleus
- The relationship between physical direction and dimensional saturation is not intuitive
- Random door selection = random movement through the danger gradient
- **This is specific to this film's cube mechanics**

### Navigation Methods and Gradient Detection (Discovered by Barry and Josh)
**Observable Gradients and Markers:**
- Temperature gradients (protection field pulls heat from surrounding dimensional space)
- Electromagnetic field strength variations
- Visual distortion at thresholds between zones
- Acoustic resonance patterns (different echo patterns indicate proximity to landmarks)
- **Quantum gradient measurement:** Lower gradient = safer/closer to orbital; higher gradient = more dangerous/farther from orbital
- **Moving away from an orbital = increasing the gradient = increasing danger**

### Dimensional Orbitals Theory
**What Orbitals Are:**
- A "dimensional orbital" is a stable region or shell at a specific distance from a dimensional nucleus
- Like electron orbitals in atomic physics, these are shells based on distance, not trajectory paths
- Being within a stable orbital shell = safe navigation
- Being between orbital shells = random/dangerous movement

**Why This Matters:**
- In n=3 space, movement is intuitive (left/right/up/down corresponds to physical location)
- In n=0.333 space, physical direction doesn't correspond to dimensional position
- You must navigate by orbital shells (distance from nuclei), not spatial direction
- Without understanding orbitals, all movement is effectively random

### Three Nuclei Navigation
**Root-Space Has Three Nuclei:**
- Each nucleus generates its own single orbital shell
- The three orbital shells overlap in certain locations
- Where orbital shells overlap = safest zones for navigation and ideal zones for safe re-alignment
- Where all three orbital patterns reinforce each other instead of canceling out

**The Lab Building and Its Room:**
- The lab building was transported into the cube using cube technology (explained in Scene 12)
- The building takes up about 1/8 of the cube room space
- **Important distinction:** The ROOM is what matters for re-alignment, not the building itself
- The room is located at an orbital shell overlap zone (appears random, but may not be coincidence)
- The field generator in the building protects it from dimensional instability
- The protection field is reinforced by the natural stability that's already at the overlap zone (not fighting against instability)
- **Cube rearrangement:** When the n=3 cube mechanically rearranges rooms, the lab building room does NOT move - the cube rearranges around it
- This makes the room the most reliable/stable location in root-space
- The building is essentially a landmark indicating the safe room location

**Barry's Death:**
- Josh was there when Barry died
- Barry's device (the quantameter) was destroyed
- Josh managed to get Barry's notebook with all the research (equations, ideas, tables/charts to map the cube)
- The device itself saved and sent the measurement data, not the notebook

## 3. MEMORY ERASURE MECHANICS

### The Problem
When people transition from n=0.333 BACK to n=3 space, their memories are erased. This is a major obstacle to escape.

### How It Works (Pseudo-Science)
- The transition from n=3 to n=0.333 has NO memory effect
- Memory erasure occurs during the RETURN from n=0.333 to n=3
- When returning to three-space, the dimensional vibration shift erases memories
- The vibrational energy damps (decreases) during the transition back to n=3
- As the vibration damps, the memory information encoded in it is lost
- This is why previous cube victims (referenced in earlier Cube films) woke up with no memory of how they got there

### The Solution (Discovered in Act 3, Scene 21)
- Morris proposes replicating the lab building's protective field as an "electron cloud shield" on memories
- Nina corrects: this would only slow the dampening, not fully solve the problem
- Yuki realizes: an electron barrier can shield neural patterns during the transition
- The electron shield protects memory information during the vibration shift
- Two potential methods emerge from the discussion:
  1. **Measurement method**: Scan and save memory information before it fully damps (Morris's initial idea)
  2. **Direct absorption**: If vibration dissipates slowly enough in 3D space, it can be directly absorbed at subatomic level (Nina and Yuki's refinement)
- Nina and Yuki design and build small personal devices to create this electron shield (one device per person)
- The shield energy must dissipate properly in three-space after transition
- Concept inspired by the protective field around the lab building that maintains stability in root-space
- **Important**: The theoretical breakthrough happens ON-SCREEN in Scene 21, practical application happens OFF-SCREEN
- Josh's final wink implies the devices may not even be necessary (ambiguous ending note)

### Writing Notes
- Scene 21 establishes the theoretical foundation through Morris/Nina/Yuki discussion
- Keep technical details vague but consistent with Scene 21's established mechanics
- Morris contributes initial "mind shield" thought experiment (Act 3, Scene 21)
- Nina corrects and refines the concept (vibrational dampening)
- Yuki makes the breakthrough (electron barrier shields neural patterns)
- Between scenes, Nina and Yuki work out mathematics and build the devices
- Avoid overly technical explanations beyond what's in Scene 21

## 4. DIMENSIONAL TRANSPORT MECHANICS

### Barry's Cryptic Message (No Explanation Yet)
Before losing contact, Barry sent fragmentary messages to the team. One phrase stood out: **"re-aligning the harmonic to the dimensional orbital."**

### Dimensional Harmonics
- Every dimensional space (n=0, n=0.333, n=3, etc.) vibrates at a natural harmonic frequency
- Objects and people naturally resonate at the harmonic of their origin dimension
- This is related to the dimensional vibrations that cause memory erasure (see MEMORY ERASURE MECHANICS)
- When you enter a different dimensional space, your matter begins resonating with that new harmonic
- The resonance shift is what allows you to exist in the alternate dimension
- **Root-space (n=0.333) is a natural harmonic of three-space (n=3)**: The fact that humans can exist in root-space means it's a harmonic resonance, not an incompatible dimension (Nina's explanation in Act 3, Scene 21)

**Re-Alignment Principle (Barry's Theory):**
- To transport back from root-space to three-space, you must re-align your harmonic frequency
- **The process:** Increase the energy of your harmonic vibration → this changes your harmonic frequency → allows safe transport through dimensional space
- What keeps people from going back is their harmonics aren't "in tune" with three-space anymore
- **Re-alignment can happen anywhere if you have the device**, but:
  - The device must be properly calibrated for safety
  - Re-alignment at orbital overlap zones is even safer due to higher dimensional stability
  - Not required to be at overlap zone, but it's the optimal location

### Quantameter Functionalities
**Barry's Device:**
- Barry built a dimensional resonance detector from a quantameter
- The quantameter is linked to the root-cube transport machine in the lab
- This link is why it can reliably reach Barry (though this may only be clear to Marcus and Josh)
- **One-way communication**: Barry can only send data back, cannot receive messages

**What It Measures:**
- The quantameter is a "measure everything" tool - it can measure both known and unknown gradients
- **Quantum gradient:** The dimensional gradient/danger level of a location
- **Calibration process:** Barry analyzed the data and manually reprogrammed/reconfigured the device to track specific gradients
- In Scene 25, Josh will calibrate Marcus's quantameter correctly based on Barry's notebook
- The team has some idea about what the actual gradients are, but there are too many to memorize - they have to trust the machine
- **For navigation:** The device determines whether a room is on a safe orbital shell by measuring the quantum gradient

**Two Functions:**
1. **Collecting Data** - Measuring the gradients when a transport happens; device saves and sends this data automatically
2. **Initiating Harmonic Shift** - Actually performing the transport (re-alignment)

**Transport Capabilities:**
- **Barry's device:** Could only transport to the root-space transmitter (linked to the lab building's equipment)
- **Marcus's device (Act 3, Scene 25):** Can transport to anywhere - not limited to the transmitter
- Marcus built his device better than Barry's prototype, giving it more flexible transport capabilities

**What Barry Sent Back (Only Two Transmissions):**
1. **First transmission** (Scene 25): Message sent when Lea and Marcus are alone
2. **Second transmission** (Scene 6): "WE'RE ALL DYING" message scratched on sof-tak skin

**What QL Team Sends To Barry:**
- When QL team sends things in to him, they include analysis of the data he uses plus whatever else might help
- Barry cannot send messages back, only receive

**What Others Know:**
- The QL team knows the data is trying to find the right conditions to transport back, but can't figure out what else could help Barry
- Marcus's device is able to create a link back on its own
- Device was destroyed when Barry died

**By Scene 25, Known Information:**
- Josh, Lea, Alex, and possibly Marcus know that the lab building room is safe to transport from

### Connection to Other Mechanics
- The dimensional vibrations that cause memory erasure (MEMORY ERASURE MECHANICS) are the same harmonics used for transport
- Transport requires understanding both navigation (ROOT CUBE SPECIFIC MECHANICS) and harmonic re-alignment
