CHARACTER PROFILE: YUKI

========================================
BASIC INFORMATION
========================================
Name: Yuki
Role: Supporting character, mathematician survivor
Occupation: Mathematician, Quantum Logistics team
Status: Survivor

========================================
ARCHETYPE
========================================
Primary: The Analyst - Uses mathematical precision to understand chaos, quantifies emotion through probability
Secondary: The Loyalist - Part of mathematician trio, deep bonds with Nina and Rashid

Shifts: Fast-talking mathematician in trio (Act 1) → Grief-stricken analyst quantifying despair (Act 2 mid-late after Rashid's death) → Survivor haunted by rhythm of absence (Act 3). Defection driven by statistical reasoning masking emotional breakdown. Kills Darius with Nina after Morris's murder. Arc shows grief manifesting as conversational gaps where Rashid would speak, analytical mind both strength and defense mechanism.

========================================
CHARACTER ARC
========================================
Beginning (Act 1): Part of fast-talking mathematician trio with Nina and Rashid. Scene 3 - rapid-fire group conversations. Scene 6 - squints at chalkboard, can't help correcting equation "this equation is wrong. The denominator should be squared", corrects instinctively mid-conversation, whispers to Rashid "Can you even measure zero dimensions?", realizes "They're conscious. They're aware in there." Shows analytical precision and close working relationship with Rashid. Technical comments, discussions with trio. Part of existing quantum team dynamic.

Middle (Act 2, Scenes 1-8): Continues trio dynamic with Nina/Rashid doing calculations and solving puzzles together. Scene 4 - solves Fibonacci with Nina/Rashid, calls sequence to Chen, emotional breakdown "It's not fair...It's rigged" watching Alex struggle. Scene 5 - works on locks with Nina, screams "RASHID!" when he dies - first major loss breaking her. Scene 6 - stays with Nina, insulted as "bootlicker" by Darius. Scene 7 - Sofia's vacuum death triggers complete breakdown, exchanges glance with Nina, crying "We just... she just...", voice cracks "Darius was right.", escalates to screaming "DARIUS WAS RIGHT! He was RIGHT!", turns toward walls "DARIUS! DARIUS!", keeps screaming "DARIUS! WHERE ARE YOU?! YOU WERE RIGHT!" - voice echoes to Darius two rooms away, mathematical mind forced to admit pattern she denied. Scene 8 - defects to Darius with Nina/Morris, voice cracks "You were right.", explains "The probability of escape is too low. We keep losing people." - quantifies hopelessness through statistics, uses math to justify emotional decision driven by grief. Witnesses Darius attack Edgar and Chen's death in horror, yanks Morris off activating tile to save him.

End (Act 3, Scenes 21-25): Scene 21 - with Darius's group, amused "A mind shield!" at Morris's naming, fast-talks with Nina about electron barrier, pauses where Rashid would have contributed - grief manifests as conversational gaps, realizes "As long as we can have an electron shield, we can remember", continues building ideas. Scene 24 - excited about electron frequency, laughs at Morris's HR joke, climbs through threshold second after Nina, screams "NO!" when Morris kicked into fog, eyes meet Nina's in split-second communication, shoves Darius HARD simultaneously with Nina killing him, watches him shatter, voice very small "We just...", voice breaks "How are we supposed to-- Morris was--", survivor's guilt with Nina about not stopping Darius, refocuses "The lab building. We still need to find it." Scene 25 - at lab building with Marcus when Alex arrives, body language shows standing apart won't look at Marcus, exchanges glances with Nina keeping secret, hands ball into fists, voice tight "Took it while we slept" about stolen equipment, keeps hand near pocket with hidden memory device, whispered "It's still running?", voice small "Thousands" about trapped people, emotional "I just want to remember. Morris. Rashid. Everyone who died. I don't want them to erase us", reaches for Nina's hand and they grip tightly, hands near pockets with secret device they keep from Marcus. Survives. Arc completed: mathematician who uses analysis as defense mechanism, grief manifests structurally through rhythm of absence where Rashid would speak, analytical mind quantifies despair to justify defection, kills betrayer to protect memory of the dead, survivor desperate to remember.

========================================
RELATIONSHIPS
========================================
- **Nina**: Deepest bond. Fast-talking mathematician trio partner, after Rashid's death adapts rhythm to duo. Exchanges glances communicating without words (annoyance at Darius, split-second decision to kill him). Works together on electron barrier solution. Scene 24 - eyes meet, shove Darius simultaneously, survivor's guilt together "We couldn't have stopped him." Scene 25 - exchanges glances keeping memory device secret from Marcus, reaches for Nina's hand and they grip tightly, hands near pockets with hidden device. Nonverbal communication shows they don't need words to understand each other's reactions. Survives together.

- **Rashid**: Trio member with Nina. Whispers technical asides to him during conversations, fast-talking collaborative rhythm. Scene 5 - screams "RASHID!" when he dies, first major loss. Scene 21 - pauses where Rashid would have contributed, grief manifests as conversational gaps. Scene 24 - after Morris dies "How are we supposed to-- Morris was--" echoes earlier Rashid loss. Rhythm of absence haunts her conversations, structural manifestation of grief.

- **Darius**: Scene 7 - Sofia's death triggers her breakdown, voice cracks "Darius was right.", escalates to screaming "DARIUS! DARIUS! WHERE ARE YOU?! YOU WERE RIGHT!" - mathematical mind forced to admit his pattern. Scene 8 - defects to him with Nina/Morris "You were right", explains statistical reasoning. Scene 21 - social blindness to his manipulation when she says "Kind of but the opposite" inadvertently telling him he's wrong, doesn't realize it triggers hostility. Scene 24 - after Morris's murder, shoves him HARD simultaneously with Nina, watches him shatter, survivor's guilt about not stopping him sooner.

- **Morris**: Scene 21 - amused "A mind shield!" at his playful naming. Scene 24 - laughs at his HR joke, watches Darius kick him into freeze fog, screams "NO!", survivor's guilt with Nina "We couldn't have stopped him", emotional "Morris. Rashid. Everyone who died" wants to remember him.

- **Marcus**: Supervisor. Scene 25 - stands apart won't look at him, hands ball into fists, voice tight "Took it while we slept" about stolen equipment, exchanges glances with Nina keeping memory device secret from him, whispered "It's still running?" about cube. Doesn't trust him despite working together. Keeps secret as act of defiance/protection.

- **Alex**: Food team colleague after integration. Scene 4 - emotional breakdown watching her struggle "It's not fair...It's rigged." Scene 25 - at lab building when Alex arrives.

- **Chen**: Quantum team colleague. Scene 4 - calls out Fibonacci sequence "One, one, two, three, five, eight!" to help him solve trap.

- **Lea**: Quantum team colleague, less prominent relationship.

========================================
DIALOGUE STYLE
========================================
**Fast-Talking Mathematician (Act 1-2 Early):**
- Matter-of-fact technical precision deflates panic: "'Just right there' might not mean the same in zero space-time, but yeah"
- Whispers technical asides to Rashid: "That's if it's not subatomic"
- Fast-talking trio rhythm - overlapping, completing thoughts, gets cut off mid-speculation
- Calls out sequences clearly to help: "One, one, two, three, five, eight!" - teaching mode under pressure
- Questions fairness through math lens: "It's not fair. If it's random, why is it always so hard? It's rigged"
- Offers help acknowledging difficulty: "Those are hard calculations. Nina and I will help" - practical assessment paired with loyalty
- Celebration through enthusiastic praise: "That was brilliant!" - genuine excitement without elaboration

**Grief and Breakdown (Act 2 Mid-Late):**
- Screams name in crisis: "RASHID!" - raw terror, no time for more words
- Incomplete fragmented grief - can't finish sentences, ellipses show mind struggling to process
- Prophetic validation through escalation: "Darius was right" then "DARIUS WAS RIGHT! He was RIGHT!" - quiet cracked to desperate screaming
- Screaming through cube walls: "DARIUS! WHERE ARE YOU?! YOU WERE RIGHT!" - calling not knowing if he can hear, breakdown of composure
- Mathematical articulation of despair: "The probability of escape is too low. We keep losing people" - quantifies hopelessness through statistics
- Simple declarative address: "Darius" - single name carries weight of acknowledgment
- Mathematical mind translates emotion into probability - can't process grief without quantifying, analytical framework as defense mechanism

**Scientific Collaboration (Act 3):**
- Amused enthusiasm for playful naming: "A mind shield!" - exclamation shows delight in Morris's creativity
- Fast-talking scientific building: "When we return to three-space, the vibration shift erases memories. But if we shield the neural patterns—" - explains problem and solution in same breath, interrupted by Nina completing thought
- Affirmation with incomplete follow-through: "That's exactly right. If we could scan fast enough—" - validates then pauses where Rashid would finish
- Simplified conclusion: "As long as we can have an electron shield, we can remember" - distills debate to core outcome
- Continues building ideas: "We need to calculate the electron frequency. Maybe use the building's field as a template—" - thinking faster than speaking
- Honest but brief: "Kind of but the opposite" - social blindness doesn't realize inadvertently triggering Darius's hostility
- Pauses where Rashid would contribute - trio's tempo disrupted by missing voice, grief embedded in structure not content

**Final Resolve (Act 3 Scene 24-25):**
- Single word scream: "NO!" - mathematician reduced to single negation watching Morris shatter
- Confirms shared intuition: "I felt it too. His tone was...off" - validates Nina's guilt, understatement can't capture wrongness
- Imperative comfort refusing blame: "Don't. Don't do that to yourself. We couldn't have stopped him" - calculates impossibility of prevention
- Quiet certainty as commitment: "(quiet, but certain) Then we make sure we remember" - internal resolve, distills to single most important thing
- Emotional declaration: "I just want to remember. Morris. Rashid. Everyone who died. I don't want them to erase us" - drops analytical distance for raw need
