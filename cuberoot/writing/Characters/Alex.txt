CHARACTER ARC
========================================
Beginning (Act 1): Competent food scientist, practical and focused, keeps headphones on to avoid distractions. Initially loyal to INZO but has subtle doubts (looks away from company propaganda).

Scene 4 - promises Lea not to lose anyone, learns employees are trapped in cube, agrees to help despite misgivings. Scene 8 - examines sof-tak skin message "WE'RE ALL DYING", challenges Marcus about how many people trapped, asks "Are these prisoners or employees?" Scene 9 - offers food compression help, pushes back on safety concerns. Scene 10 - realizes they're trapped, first leadership moment "We're here. We're alive. We figure it out." Passive employee becoming active participant.

Middle (Act 2, Scenes 1-10): Leadership emerges through crisis. Scene 1 - decisive "No one's coming. WE ARE the rescue.", partners with Edgar. Scene 2 - supports bringing Josh despite risks. Scene 3 - manages Morris disappearance, defends trusting Josh to Darius "He knows this place. We don't." Scene 4 - volunteers last gets worst path, completes through willpower. Scene 5 - watches Rashid die, rallies team adopting Josh's "keep moving" mantra showing she learns from everyone. Scene 6 - multiple attempts to stop Darius "Darius, please. Don't do this", keeps Morris loyal through silent eye contact, rallies remaining team "Stay close. Watch each other." Scene 7 - screams "Sofia!" with joy then watches Marcus's command kill her, nearly pulled in, screams "LEA!" protecting her, tries to stop Yuki's breakdown. Scene 8 - bitter "No thanks to you" to Darius, watches Yuki/Nina/Morris defect, screams "CHEN, NO—!", helps Marcus drag dying Chen, closes his eyes, enumerates losses "Morris. Nina. Yuki. Now Chen.", chooses restraint "We don't engage. We defend ourselves if we must. But we don't hunt them", moral clarity "The cube is the enemy. Not them." Scene 9 - screams "Edgar! No!", cradles dying Edgar "No. No, Edgar...", finds strength "We save ourselves first. Then we try", honors him "He would want us to keep moving." Scene 10 - argues exploration key to survival vs Marcus's engineering, pleads "Marcus, please. Don't do this alone", leads group with Lea/Josh.

Scene 25 - asks him to verify Marcus's device showing she trusts Josh's expertise over Marcus despite Josh's changed nature.
