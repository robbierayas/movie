CHARACTER PROFILE: DARIUS

========================================
BASIC INFORMATION
========================================
Name: Darius
Role: Supporting character, Food Experimentation team member
Occupation: Food Science Researcher, Food Experimentation team
Status: DECEASED - Dies in Act 3, Scene 24 (killed by Nina and Yuki after murdering Morris)

========================================
ARCHETYPE
========================================
Primary: The Skeptic - Questions everything, doubts plans, voice of caution
Secondary: The Betrayer - Turns on group, self-interested (driven by fear not malice)

Shifts: Empathetic critical thinker (Act 1) → Paranoid skeptic (Act 2 early) → Isolated leader (Act 2 late) → Murderer (Act 3) → Victim. Wounded idealism transforms into paranoia then violence. Becomes the threat he feared.

========================================
CHARACTER ARC
========================================
Beginning (Act 1): Critical thinker on Food team. Challenges ideas to strengthen them, not undermine. Catches details others miss. Shows empathy (Barry's kids) and scientific enthusiasm when engaged. Marcus pulls him aside in Scene 10, reveals INZO's brutal "death penalty" culture - plants seed of paranoia. Jaw tightens at department elimination. Values thoroughness and complete information.

Middle (Act 2, Scenes 1-8): Quiet and processing Marcus's revelation, internal conflict visible. Paranoia grows - suspicious of Josh, questions trusting him "Blindly". Watches Rashid die in Scene 5 - breaking point. "We're going to die here." Complete break in Scene 6 - declares "I'm done", accuses company leaders of sacrificing non-managers, proposes farming plan, "resigns from INZO" in the cube. NO ONE joins him. Leaves alone, calls them "Bootlickers", predicts "you're dead." Maintains softness only for Alex - "quiet, almost sad" wishing she'd come. Hears screaming in Scene 7, moves toward sound (humanity remains). In Scene 8, gains 3 followers (Yuki/Nina/Morris). Attacks Edgar specifically - blames him for everything as corporate symbol. Grapples with Chen, swings crowbar, shoves Chen into dissolving wall causing fatal burns. Horror and guilt flash across face seeing Chen dragged. Exits haunted: "We keep moving. Away from them." Severe leg burns from floor trap.

End (Act 3, Scenes 21-24): Leads group of 6 but increasingly isolated. Irritated by theory discussions, dismissive, walks alone ahead. Scene 24 - watches Morris make Nina/Yuki laugh with annoyance. Trapped in freeze fog room with Morris. Disingenuously asks "You can help me?" and "All I have to do is ask?" Makes Morris think he's considering help. Cold: "I am DONE asking" - kicks Morris into freeze fog. Morris shatters. Starts justifying "He was weak. Survival of the--" Nina and Yuki shove him back into fog room. Floats frozen mid-flight, slams into wall head-first, shatters. Killed by the people he recruited. Wounded idealism became paranoia became murder became death.

========================================
CHARACTER FUNCTION
========================================
- Voice of skepticism that transforms into paranoia
- Cautionary tale: fear of corporate leaders kills him, not the leaders themselves
- Validates his own predictions (team dies) while disproving them (he dies first, killed by followers not leaders)
- Shows cost of distrust and isolation
- Becomes the threat he feared - murderer who kills followers
- Demonstrates cube exploiting fear and distrust
- Wounded idealism transforming into violence
- Tragic because he's right about corporate brutality but wrong about the solution

========================================
DIALOGUE STYLE
========================================
- Catches details others miss with forensic attention: "You said one person. The message says 'we're all dying.' Plural"
- Direct, minimal filler, gets straight to the point - concise where Morris is verbose
- Questions without hostility initially, genuinely wanting complete answers before proceeding
- Genuine enthusiasm when engaged by science: "Oh sweet, I didn't know about that part" - reveals distrust is learned not inherent
- Growing distrust transforms tone from professional skepticism to fearful directness: "You'd put our lives in his hands?"
- Single-word or brief responses when bitter: "Blindly." or "Watch me." - encapsulates entire arguments, dares contradiction
- Physical reactions show attention without engagement - ears perk up at key words but doesn't look, absorbing silently
- Declarative break statements end conversations: "I'm done." - finality without explanation
- Bitter laugh punctuates dismissal, escalating accusations build with each phrase, weaponizes others' words against them
- "Bootlickers" repeated as final insult - lets word reverberate, makes it their defining memory of him
- Dark prophecies delivered as certainties not threats: "Next time I see you? You're dead. Because you followed them."
- Voice changes only for Alex: "quiet, almost sad" - shows capacity for softness only with her, hardness toward others is performed
- "There is no out" repeated as fundamental truth - certainty born from Marcus's revelation and Rashid's death
- Distinguishes between Alex and corporate leaders: "I trust you, Alex. But them?" - makes emotional hierarchy explicit
- Dramatic declarations weaponize corporate language: "I'm resigning from INZO. Right here. Right now."
- Switches from persuasion to bitter insult when rejected - wounded idealism, insults are defensive armor against feeling abandoned
- Shifts pronouns to personalize: "YOUR leadership" not "THEIR" - makes targets feel weight directly
- Brief validations establish authority without warmth: "Smart choice." or "You're still alive." - observations carry resentment or confirmation
- Demands framed as needs not requests: "We'll need more supplies" - expectation not negotiation
- Total accusations compressed: "This is all your fault. The cube, the deaths, everything. You and your corporate masters."
- Haunted directives with spatial emphasis: "We keep moving. Away from them." - quiet tone shows he's shaken not triumphant
- Sarcastic dismissal from spatial distance - speaks from behind, already separated himself physically
- Rhetorical questions that undermine: "Are you? Sounds like you're planning what to do after we're already there"
- Strategic silence as rejection - non-response is answer, uses physical movement to avoid confrontation
- Feigned interest to test loyalty - asks questions but doesn't care about answers, checking engagement levels
- Physical force escalation - throws objects with progressive intensification mirroring building anger
- Disingenuous questions set up betrayal: "You can help me?" then "All I have to do is ask?" - sociopathic performance weaponized against kindness
- Final rejection with cold emphasis: "I am DONE asking" - caps show finality, present tense makes it identity, renunciation becomes murder weapon
