========================================
CHARACTER ARC
========================================
Beginning (Act 1): Brilliant dimensional physicist in Quantum Logistics, burdened by knowledge of people trapped in n=0.333 - urgent concern because if profit runs out, company will make them disappear. Scene 3 - recognizes Alex, invites her for coffee. Scene 4 - emotional, warns Alex about company, voice cracks about trapped employees, reveals too much (breaks need-to-know protocol) because wants Alex's activist perspective, remembers going to protest together in college, thinks Alex still sees her that way. Scene 8 - explains Barry's communication, breath catches when Josh mentioned, can't finish talking about him "Josh was... he's—", fragmented speech reveals emotional weight. Scene 9 - wants to rescue Barry and Josh, pushes back on safety protocols driven by guilt and urgency. Scene 10 - conversation with Alex about ideals vs reality, realizes they're trapped. Knows food team integration doesn't really make sense but goes along because desperate for help. Slightly haunted, ethically grounded but unwilling to go against company due to their tactics.

Middle (Act 2, Scenes 1-10): Technical advisor and passionate advocate. Scene 1 - argues passionately to explore and find Josh/Barry/Sofia. Scene 2 - breath catches seeing Josh alive but changed, argues to bring him, protective of him. Scene 3 - suggests safety protocols, advocates trusting Josh, paired with him showing their connection. Scene 4 - recognizes Fibonacci pattern, solves puzzle with Nina/Rashid/Yuki. Scene 5 - catches Marcus when freed, watches Rashid die. Scene 6 - angry at being called "company leader" and "bootlicker" by Darius. Scene 7 - nearly pulled into vacuum, realizes Josh knew "exits lie" - his cryptic warnings proven true. Scene 8 - loses Yuki/Nina/Morris to Darius, watches Chen die, Josh guides her through dissolving floor showing he still protects her despite being changed. Scene 9 - earrings pulled sharply by magnetic field, yelps "Ah—!", desperate "We have to get him out!" trying to save Edgar, tries to find safe approach but fails, quiet shock "Those are... other cubes?" seeing infinite scope, overwhelmed "We can't save them all" - physicist confronting impossible scale contrasts with earlier urgency to rescue Josh/Barry, respectful eulogy for Edgar "From corporate fool to leader. He earned that." Scene 10 - torn between both approaches "I see both sides", refuses to choose "You're both right. You're both wrong", desperate "I won't split you up by choosing. I can't lose anyone else", joins Alex's group with Josh. Cumulative losses and failure to save everyone weighs on her.

End (Act 3, Scenes 23-25): Scene 23 - explains dimensional navigation theory from Barry's cryptic message to Alex and Josh: harmonics, orbitals, re-alignment principle - technical expertise essential to understanding escape. Breath catches when Josh reveals Barry's notebook hidden under shirt, asks "Josh, why didn't you show us this before?", excited reading Barry's notes "This is everything we need", touches Josh's hand softly after he admits "I was there when he died", soft moment "It's good to have you back. The real you" - connection with Josh provides emotional anchor and scientific breakthrough, his lucidity during science discussion shows path to reconnection. Scene 25 - arrives at miniaturized lab building "It's here. But it's... we can't fit through that", tension visible as Marcus discusses device, steps back in fear when Marcus activates it "Marcus, be careful--", won't meet Alex's eyes out of fear, quietly "We should listen to him" driven by fear not conviction, urgent "Alex, please. We need to work together" trying to prevent conflict, resigned "What choice do we have?" presenting cube vs corporate prison as only options, heavy resignation "If we make it back, we have to show profit. Make this worth their investment. Or we become liabilities" - compliance driven by fear of company tactics throughout. Survives. Arc completed: from desperate rescuer willing to break protocol, to passionate advocate protecting Josh and solving puzzles, to fear-driven compliant survivor who chooses corporate prison over cube prison. College activist ideals fully crushed by corporate reality and fear. Connection with Josh in Scene 23 provides moment of hope and scientific breakthrough before final resignation.

DIALOGUE STYLE
========================================
**Technical Expert with Emotional Weight:**
- Technical precision with emotional weight: "They go in. We just... can't get them out"
- Voice tightens/cracks repeatedly under emotional strain - physical constriction reveals choking on secrets and guilt, body betrays control
- Fragmented speech when emotional: "Josh was... he's—" can't finish sentence, ellipses show emotional processing
- Explanatory but not condescending when teaching dimensional theory
- Scientific accuracy balanced with urgency
- Can switch instantly from technical explanation to desperate questioning
- Discovery announcement with awe: "Look. The magnetic field..." trails off, scientist observing even in grief
- Question confirming impossible sight: "Those are... other cubes?" (quiet shock) - needs confirmation, hesitation to believe
- Sometimes reveals too much to Alex (breaks need-to-know protocol) because desperate

- Passionate urgency in arguments: needs to explore, find Josh and Barry
- Makes promises with conviction: "We have to get them out. Barry. Josh. We have to"
- Advocates for Josh with simple conviction: "We need to trust Josh. He understands this place" - no elaborate argument, just truth
- Protective warnings to colleagues
- Practical safety suggestions delivered calmly: "We should take turns. Check each room before everyone goes through"
- Urgent commands when protecting: "Stay there! Don't move!" - no hesitation, directive
- Questions Josh urgently: "Josh, can you find him? The way you navigate—" incomplete, desperate
- Ellipses show grief/relief: "You're alive. You're... you're here" - pauses reveal internal processing

**Crisis and Loss:**
- Painful vocalization: "Ah—!" - sharp sound, no time for words, physical reaction to danger
- Desperate plea: "We have to get him out!" - protective urgency, physicist trying to problem-solve
- Exhaustion shows: "We lost someone already" - tired voice, weight of losses
- Overwhelmed admission: "We can't save them all" - confronting infinite scope, contrasts with earlier rescue urgency
- Respectful eulogy: "From corporate fool to leader. He earned that" (voice tight) - traces Edgar's arc, grief beneath assessment
- Asks reflective questions: "Is this what we wanted? Is this what we deserved?" - genuine self-interrogation, auditing own complicity in real-time

- Won't meet Alex's eyes - guilt and fear visible through avoidance
- Quietly advocates out of fear not conviction: "We should listen to him"
- Urgent plea to prevent conflict: "Alex, please. We need to work together"
- Resigned questions: "What choice do we have?" - presenting cube vs corporate prison as only options
- Heavy resignation: "If we make it back, we have to show profit. Make this worth their investment. Or we become liabilities"
