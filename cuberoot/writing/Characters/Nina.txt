========================================
ARCHETYPE
========================================
Primary: The Idealist - Youngest scientist who believes ethics matter, not yet jaded, wants justice for trapped people
Secondary: The Analyst - Brilliant mathematical mind, presents data with clinical precision, recognizes patterns others miss

Shifts: Idealistic mathematician in fast-talking trio (Act 1) → Grief-stricken defector following statistical logic (Act 2 mid-late after Rashid's death) → Survivor with manifesto for justice (Act 3). Defection driven by pattern recognition "Rashid, Sofia... who's next?" - idealism sees pattern it can't deny. Kills Darius with Yuki after Morris's murder. Arc shows idealism redirected not crushed - wants to expose INZO's truth, save trapped people, make Morris's death meaningful. Youngest perspective means hasn't learned to guard idealism yet.

========================================
CHARACTER ARC
========================================
Beginning (Act 1): Youngest scientist on either team, brilliant mathematical mind, part of fast-talking trio with Rashid and Yuki. Scene 3 - idealistic safety question cut off, fast-talking with Rashid/Yuki. Scene 6 - explains memory erasure problem to Morris using snow globe metaphor "imagine shaking a snow globe. All that information just... disperses", grins at Yuki fixing wrong equation "That's been wrong for three weeks", realizes "They're in root-space with it. The sof-tak appeared there" when message comes back, exchanges look with Rashid and Yuki understanding Barry/Josh are conscious and suffering. Scene 8 - reveals new data analysis "the kind that changes everything". Scene 9 - presents full analysis showing exponential acceleration, "root cube doesn't discriminate". Scene 10 - discusses mathematical implications. Idealistic, makes statements about ethics and doing the right thing. Used to Edgar and Marcus siding with company, disappointed when Lea does too - expected better from her. Warms up to food team when they make rebellious statements, opens up more around people who question authority. Not yet cynical about corporate ethics.

Middle (Act 2, Scenes 1-8): Continues as technical expert and idealist. Scene 1 - idealistic "We can't just abandon people". Scene 2 - dividing devices with Rashid/Yuki, idealistic about bringing Josh. Scene 3 - "Dr. Schroedinger, I presume?" comic relief, paired with Yuki. Scene 4 - figures out Fibonacci pattern with Rashid/Yuki, directs Chen, counts for Alex. Scene 5 - works on locks with Yuki, hugs Rashid after rescue, screams "NO!" when he dies - first major loss breaking her. Scene 6 - idealistic refusal to abandon people, called "bootlicker" by Darius. Scene 7 - exchanges glance with Yuki, holds Yuki when vacuum pulls, reaches for Yuki "Yuki, no—", desperate "We can't... we can't fall apart now" trying to hold team together. Scene 8 - defects to Darius with Yuki and Morris, validates Yuki's logic "She's right. Rashid, Sofia... who's next?" - pattern recognition through grief, idealism sees pattern it can't deny, states alternative plan "Find somewhere to survive. Stop chasing the exit that doesn't exist" - idealism redirected toward new purpose, witnesses Darius attack Edgar and Chen's death in horror, grabs Darius when he gets leg burns shouting "Darius!" showing transfer of faith to new leader, helps wrap his burns. Defection driven by statistical pattern and grief, not abandonment of ideals.

End (Act 3, Scenes 21-25): Scene 21 - with Darius's group, immediately interested when Morris mentions field generator, corrects Morris's "mind shield" gently "Morris, that wouldn't fully solve the memory problem. The vibrational energy would damp at a slower rate, but it'd still damp", fast-talking revelation with Yuki "But Yuki! If the vibration slow enough dissipates in 3D space, it might be directly absorbed", pauses where Rashid would have contributed - grief through absence, encourages Morris warmly "You did help. This is huge", stands up to Darius with measured firmness "We're working on the navigation, Darius" then "We can do both, Darius", casual connection with Morris "Same, bro" when he apologizes. Scene 24 - excited about memory shield devices, grins "We'll remember, Morris. Everything", climbs through threshold first, screams "MORRIS!" when he's kicked into fog, watches him freeze back-to-front and shatter, eyes meet Yuki's in split-second communication, shoves Darius HARD simultaneously with Yuki killing him, watches him shatter, voice shaking "He killed Morris", reflects with guilt "I felt it. When he asked those questions... I knew something was wrong", voice breaking "I should have said something. I should have warned Morris—", idealistic manifesto builds: "It's all been wrong. From the beginning. INZO, the company, using root-space to trap prisoners— using PEOPLE like they're disposable—" then "But we have a way to tear it all down", credits Morris "Morris helped us figure it out", determination "They can't have this. INZO can't have root-space, can't keep using it to make people disappear. And we can't let them make US disappear", insists "We have to get back, we have to make sure the truth gets out— to the public, to everyone", modal verbs "We CAN save the people still trapped here. We CAN make it right", conditional "But only if we remember. Only if we get the truth out before they silence us", quietly "Then we make sure we remember" - idealism transformed into manifesto for justice. Scene 25 - with Marcus at lab building when Alex arrives, won't look at Marcus stands apart, quiet flat "Dead" about Darius/Morris, opens mouth to explain but Marcus cuts her off, exchanges glances with Yuki keeping memory device secret from Marcus, jaw clenches when Marcus justifies taking equipment, quiet bitter "He used our equipment", keeps hand near pocket with hidden device, exchanges glances with Yuki throughout never revealing device, quiet horror "Hundreds of people trapped in here", quiet "So we're just... giving up?", reaches for Yuki's hand and they grip tightly, hands near pockets with secret device they keep to themselves. Survives. Arc completed: youngest idealist whose idealism gets redirected not crushed - wants to expose INZO's truth, save trapped people, ensure Morris's death has meaning, refuses to let company silence them. Pattern recognition applied to corporate evil, not just cube deaths.
