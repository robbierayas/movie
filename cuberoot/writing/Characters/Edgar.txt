CHARACTER PROFILE: EDGAR

========================================
BASIC INFORMATION
========================================
Name: Edgar
Role: Oblivious corporate overseer, tragic innocent
Occupation: Corporate VP of Logistics
Status: DEAD (Act 2, Scene 9 - Magnetic Pulse Trap, metal hips)

========================================
ARCHETYPE
========================================
Primary: The Innocent - Genuinely doesn't know what INZO really does, believes in stated mission
Secondary: The Leader - Takes charge during crisis, protects team, grows into role

Shifts: Oblivious corporate overseer (Act 1 early) → Transformed leader after Scene 9 realization (Act 1 late - Act 2). Dies heroically trying to save team. Never learns full truth about INZO's root-space experiments or permanent trapping. Corporate habits repurposed for survival rather than abandoned.

========================================
CHARACTER ARC
========================================
Beginning (Act 1, Scenes 1-8): Confident corporate VP managing team integration. Understands business and logistics, NOT science. Knows INZO uses n=3 cubes for prisoner containment, thinks Quantum Logistics (QL) is hypercube-related logistics. Doesn't know about root-space experiments or that people get trapped there permanently. Genuinely believes INZO is ethical within parameters he understands. Uses casual corporate language, makes jokes about "dollarinos", does synergy gestures. Morally sound but catastrophically ignorant. More hands-on because boss ("Jefe") has concerns. Views Food team reassignment as routine personnel allocation. Calls Barry's trapping "acceptable risk", oblivious to implications.

Middle (Act 1, Scene 9 - Act 2, Scene 6): Transformation in Scene 9 when hypercube singularity starts pulling in buildings. Sees scope of crisis, admits "I've been treating this like a staffing issue." Takes charge willing to risk himself. Returns from first entry with voice cracking - they're trapped. Act 2: Grows into protective leader role. Organizes supplies, makes decisions (bringing Josh), volunteers to go first, implements buddy system and visual contact rules. Applies corporate organizational skills to survival. Transformation incomplete - still uses business analysis language ("risk assessment", "lethality metrics"). After Rashid dies in Scene 5, insists team needs rest "Five minutes, Josh. We just lost Rashid. People need a moment." - balances practical needs with emotional awareness. When Darius leaves in Scene 6, tries to reason, hurt when called "company leader", lets him go to prevent violence. Practical wisdom emerges. Guilt over Sofia leaving in Scene 9 (she dies in Act 2 Scene 7 following Marcus's command). Chen defends him from Darius's attack in Scene 8, dies with dissolving wall burns - more guilt.

End (Act 2, Scene 9): Enters metallic room, suggests rest. Feels strange pull, staggers. Reveals "My hips. I have... metal hips. Replacement." Lifted by magnetic pulse, brutally slammed into ceiling/walls/floor. Through agony screams "Get out. Go." Selfless to the end. Arc completed: oblivious corporate VP to heroic leader who dies protecting his team. Never learns full INZO truth about root-space experiments or permanent trapping. Compartmentalized knowledge kept him innocent - knows about n=3 prisoner cubes, thinks QL is hypercube logistics, doesn't understand the darker experiments happening in root-space.

========================================
PERSONALITY TRAITS
========================================
**Act 1 (Oblivious Corporate VP):**
- Understands business and logistics, NOT science
- Morally sound - genuinely believes INZO is ethical (within what he knows)
- Competent in his domain (logistics, business operations, resource allocation)
- Compartmentalized corporate knowledge: knows about n=3 prisoner cubes, thinks QL is hypercube-related logistics, doesn't know about root-space experiments or permanent trapping
- Trust in corporate structure and hierarchy
- More hands-on because boss ("Jefe") has concerns
- Concerned about profit and deliverables ("the dollarinos")
- Good intentions, catastrophic ignorance
- Uses casual/jokey corporate language ("de-shittification", "re-biggification", "n=zero-point-three-whatever")
- Believes in corporate mission statements, does "synergy" hand gestures
- Pressure from above to get results like sof-tak
- Pleasant tone even when threatening job security
- Views personnel reassignment as routine business operation

**Act 2 (Transformed Leader):**
- Oblivious cheer drops completely - quiet, shaken, determined
- Takes charge with focus, willing to risk himself first
- Practical protective leadership - volunteers for dangerous tasks, implements buddy system and visual contact rules
- Organizational skills repurposed for survival (supplies, assignments, logistics)
- Transformation incomplete - still uses business analysis terms ("risk assessment", "lethality metrics")
- Balances practical needs with emotional awareness (insists on rest after Rashid's death)
- Firm but kind authority - protective, explains reasoning, won't back down on safety
- Learning cube's rules through experience (catches himself before saying "out")
- Stands on principle - refuses Darius's demands, prevents violence through de-escalation
- Self-aware about being "corporate VP" symbol to others
- Heroic to the end - dies ordering team to escape while trapped in agony
- Never learns full INZO truth about root-space experiments or permanent trapping

========================================
PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION
========================================
- Corporate VP appearance - business attire
- Polished, professional presentation
- Likely older than Alex/Marcus (40s-50s)
- Confident body language of someone in authority
- TBD based on casting/narrative needs

========================================
RELATIONSHIPS
========================================
- Marcus: Works together on logistics at different awareness levels. Edgar knows about n=3 prisoner cubes, thinks QL is hypercube logistics. Doesn't know Marcus understands root-space experiments and permanent trapping. Moral contrast - both corporate, different awareness. Edgar remains innocent while Marcus is complicit.
- Alex: Oversees her team transition with pleasant threats about "competitive intelligence department", sees her as valuable asset to be properly allocated. After transformation, respects her capabilities, keeps her in middle (safe position) during navigation. Growing partnership as co-leaders.
- Food Team (Morris, Darius, Sofia): Responsible for their "routine" reassignment to Quantum Logistics. Doesn't understand he's sending them into danger. Sofia leaves in Act 1 Scene 9 to check on kids with his permission, dies in Act 2 Scene 7 following Marcus's command - guilt over allowing her to leave and her death. Darius targets him in Scene 8 as corporate symbol "This is all your fault... You and your corporate masters", genuinely hurt and confused, doesn't understand depth of rage.
- Chen: Electrical engineer who defends him from Darius's attack in Scene 8. Chen intervenes to stop violence, not from loyalty. Catches crowbar to ribs, shoved into dissolving wall, dies from burns. Edgar feels guilt over Chen's death defending him, states "Chen died defending me from Darius. We can't let that pattern repeat."
- Quantum Team (Lea, Nina, Rashid, Yuki): Teams he's integrating, doesn't understand their true work involves root-space experiments. After transformation becomes their protective leader. Rashid dies under his leadership in Scene 5 - first major death, teaches him to balance rest and momentum.
- INZO Corporation: True believer in company mission as he understands it. Knows about n=3 prisoner cubes (thinks this is the extent of ethical concerns), believes in rehabilitation programs, doesn't know about root-space permanent trapping experiments. Compartmentalized knowledge keeps him innocent.
- Josh: Decides to bring him despite begrudgingly acknowledging need. Welcoming friendliness to changed survivor. Josh's warnings about cube behavior teach Edgar survival rules (don't say "out", understand trap patterns).
- His boss ("Jefe"): Reports to superior who has concerns, creating pressure for hands-on management and results. Corporate hierarchy that compartmentalizes dangerous knowledge.

========================================
CHARACTER FUNCTION
========================================
- Represents institutional ignorance through compartmentalized knowledge
- Shows how corporate structure enables evil by limiting information access to "need-to-know"
- Edgar knows surface operations (n=3 prisoner cubes) but not dangerous experiments (root-space permanent trapping)
- Moral contrast to Marcus (both corporate, different awareness levels, different culpability)
- Audience surrogate for "normal" corporate world transitioning to crisis leadership
- Vehicle for exploring theme: ignorance vs. complicity, redemption through transformation
- Makes corporate evil more believable - not everyone knows, compartments prevent full picture
- Heroic arc demonstrates someone can be innocent of system's worst crimes while enabling them
- Death shows even transformed leaders can't escape consequences of institutional participation
- Tragic because he dies trying to save team, never learning what INZO really does in root-space
- His transformation from oblivious VP to protective leader provides emotional catharsis
- Demonstrates corporate organizational skills CAN be repurposed for good (survival leadership)

========================================
DIALOGUE STYLE
========================================
**Act 1 (Oblivious Corporate VP):**
- Corporate buzzwords mixed with casual slang: "KPIs", "bandwidth", "synergy potential", "dollarinos", "Jefe" (Spanish for boss)
- Makes up silly terms: "re-biggification", "en-shit-ification", "de-shittification", "n=zero-point-three-whatever"
- Pleasant tone even when threatening: "You're free to decline the assignment, Alex. Walk away. Find another job. But I should mention - the company has a whole department dedicated to competitive intelligence..."
- Casually horrific: "Not me, personally. I just do the dollarinos and KPIs"
- Oblivious cheer: "Great session. Really getting that synergy flowing"
- No scientific jargon - clearly doesn't understand it, interrupts science talk for business concerns
- Uses physical comedy: synergy hand gestures, fist pumps
- "Profit maximization" is his ultimate goal

**Act 2 (Transformed Leader):**
- Oblivious cheer drops completely - quiet, shaken voice: "How long have you known about this?"
- Admits ignorance directly: "I've been treating this like a staffing issue. Like a budget problem"
- Takes charge with focus: "Okay. Okay. We can't... we need a plan" - still shaken but determined
- Voice cracks under pressure, revealing emotional strain
- Organizational skills repurposed for survival: "Nina and Yuki. Rashid and Chen. Darius with me." - quick, clear, efficient assignments
- Firm protective directives: "Visual contact. Everyone stays where I can see you. No one else gets separated." - no room for debate, protective authority
- Decisive volunteering: "I'll go through the next one. Get it out of the way." - practical, willing to take personal risks
- Balances practical needs with emotional awareness: "Five minutes, Josh. We just lost Rashid. People need a moment." - maintains authority while showing compassion, explains reasoning, sets clear time limits
- Applies business analysis to survival: "That lethality didn't match the risk assessment. Is that normal?" - still thinking in corporate terms even in cube, shows transformation is incomplete but analytical mind is adapting
- Leadership through honoring the dead: "Keep moving. Honor Rashid by getting out." - gives purpose to grief, frames survival as memorial
- Attempts at reasoning cut off by violence: "Darius, now, we're all trying--" and "That's not realistic--" - corporate-friendly language fails against rage
- Genuinely hurt by accusations: looks "genuinely hurt and confused" when called "company leader" - dramatic irony, doesn't understand depth of INZO's operations or why he's blamed
- Simple unity principles: "We stay together. That's how we survive." - reduces survival to basics when elaborate arguments fail
- Calm practical de-escalation: "Let him go. We'll manage." - prevents violence through acceptance, pragmatic assessment that supplies aren't worth bloodshed
- Firm refusal on principle: "No. You already took enough when you left." - transformed Edgar stands ground, no corporate softening
- Calculating survival commands: "There! That tile's still white! Step there!" - organizational mind analyzing patterns in real-time, directs with clarity
- Self-awareness stated plainly: "Because I'm corporate. The VP. The face of the company to him." - accepts how others see him, understands symbolism
- Names costs to guide future: "Chen died defending me from Darius. We can't let that pattern repeat." - frames loss as lesson not guilt spiral
- Learning cube's language: nearly says "out" but stops himself - catches mistakes, internalizes rules, ongoing education
- Final scene progression: Hopeful "Maybe we can rest here" → Questioning "Did anyone else feel that?" → Gasping revelation "My hips. I have... metal hips. Replacement." → Screaming through agony → Selfless final command "Get out. Go." - dies ordering team to abandon him for their safety

========================================
MOTIVATIONS
========================================
**Act 1:**
- Effective team management and resource allocation
- Meeting corporate goals and metrics ("dollarinos and KPIs")
- Proper procedure and documentation
- Maintaining positive work environment through integration
- Career advancement through good performance
- Pleasing his boss ("Jefe") who has concerns
- Belief in INZO's stated mission within his understanding
- Ignorant good intentions - genuinely thinks he's doing ethical work

**Act 2:**
- Protecting his team from cube dangers
- Getting everyone out alive
- Learning cube's rules to increase survival chances
- Balancing practical momentum with team's emotional needs
- Preventing internal violence and maintaining unity
- Applying organizational skills to survival logistics
- Honoring the dead by succeeding (Rashid, Sofia, Chen)
- Proving he can lead in crisis despite corporate background

========================================
CHOSEN PATH - IGNORANT HERO
========================================
Edgar follows PATH B (Ignorant Casualty) with heroic transformation:
- Never learns full INZO truth about root-space experiments or permanent trapping
- Knows only about n=3 prisoner cubes, thinks QL is hypercube logistics
- Audience knows what he doesn't (dramatic irony maintained throughout)
- Transforms from oblivious corporate VP to protective leader in Act 1 Scene 9
- Dies heroically in Act 2 Scene 9 ordering team to escape while trapped in magnetic pulse
- His death highlights that even transformed innocents can't escape institutional consequences
- Explores redemption through action despite never understanding full scope of complicity
- His compartmentalized knowledge keeps dramatic irony alive until his death

========================================
DRAMATIC IRONY
========================================
- Audience knows things Edgar doesn't
- His corporate-speak about "prisoner rehabilitation programs" = cube death traps
- His "efficiency metrics" = body count
- His "resource optimization" = human experimentation
- Creates tension: when will he find out?
- Makes horror more impactful: normal people enable this

========================================
THEMATIC PURPOSE
========================================
- How do good people participate in evil systems?
- Is ignorance an excuse for complicity?
- Corporate compartmentalization enables atrocities
- "Just doing my job" taken to horrifying extreme
- Well-meaning people can cause tremendous harm
- The banality of evil in corporate form
