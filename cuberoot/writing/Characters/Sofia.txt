CHARACTER PROFILE: SOFIA

========================================
BASIC INFORMATION
========================================
Name: Sofia
Role: Background character, Food Experimentation team member
Occupation: Lab Chemist, Food Experimentation team
Status: DECEASED - Dies in Act 2, Scene 7 (Sofia's Vacuum Death)
Age: Slightly older than Alex (late 30s)
Family: Mother

========================================
ARCHETYPE
========================================
Primary: The Heart - Emotional/moral center, recognizes humanity in victims, maternal presence
Secondary: The Voice of Reason - Calls out corporate absurdity, speaks uncomfortable truths

Shifts: Maintains role consistently until death - dies precisely because she follows authority figure she spent entire Act 1 challenging (tragic irony)

========================================
CHARACTER ARC
========================================
Beginning (Act 1, Scenes 3-6): Corporate cynic with strong ethics. Recognizes danger (asks about safety), challenges dehumanization repeatedly, creates maternal warmth and bonding moments. Not invested in corporate mission - just doing her job with clear moral boundaries.

Middle (Act 1, Scenes 8-9): Continues confronting authority (challenges Edgar's "staffing issue" language), prioritizes family over crisis, leaves to check on kids trusting she can return.

End (Act 2, Scene 7): Dies following Marcus's command to press button. Tragic irony - the moral voice who challenged authority throughout Act 1 is killed by following an authority figure's urgent order. Hopeful moment ("I think it's the exit!") becomes horror. Never sees her kids again. Death demonstrates even those who see through corporate absurdity can fall victim to ingrained obedience in crisis.
