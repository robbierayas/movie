========================================
CHARACTER ARC
========================================
Beginning (Act 1): Smart but socially uncertain scientist, comic relief through uncertain delivery of correct information. Close work partner with Alex who values his intelligence. Rambles through explanations even when right. Occasionally clumsy (knocks over beaker), casually breaks protocol (eats test samples), dedicated and thoughtful. Loyal to colleagues, especially Alex. Overthinks how to explain things, not the science itself. At Lab Introduction (Scene 6) asks about memory erasure prevention, awed by dimensional compression "It's beautiful...", brings basketball-sized sof-tak "for snacking", Sofia tells warm story about him bringing sof-tak casserole to her family dinner. Receives "WE'RE ALL DYING" message and rambles uncertainly about it being concerning.

Middle (Act 2, Scenes 1-8): Terror escalates through deaths. Rambles about calculations and size transitions, helpful but nervous. Scene 3 - walks through door first absentmindedly creating sneeze scare, panicked when trapped, reappears from ceiling with "Yes Boss" quip showing vulnerability through humor. Scene 5 - watches Rashid die, tries to help, rambles about adaptive traps. Scene 6 - Darius leaves, Morris sits nearby Alex head down, internal conflict visible through body language, shifts uncomfortably when Darius asks who's coming, body language suggests stepping forward but Alex catches his eye and shakes head slightly, hesitates then stays with her, loyalty to Alex specifically (not company) keeps him from leaving, flinches when called "Bootlickers", silent throughout showing his verbal processing shuts down under emotional overwhelm. Scene 7 - hyperventilating after Sofia's vacuum death, terror building. Scene 8 - defection moment: shifts uncomfortably when Yuki steps forward citing statistics, Alex quietly asks "Morris?", he can't meet her eyes, stammers "I... the probability like Yuki said... I don't want to be... statistically...", barely audible "I'm sorry, Alex.", crosses to Darius's side driven by fear masked as statistical reasoning, witnesses Darius attack Edgar and Chen's death in horror, steps on dissolving tile, looks back at main team with guilt, looks at Darius with new fear after seeing violence.

End (Act 3, Scenes 21-24): With Darius's group, quieter, guilt-ridden. Scene 21 - proposes "mind shield" thought experiment for memory solution, Nina corrects it would only slow dampening, Morris contributes uncertainly about measuring before it damps, apologizes "Sorry, not sure where I'm going with this", Darius snaps dismissively "It's relevant when we have somewhere to apply it. Right now? It's a distraction", Morris quieter "I was just trying to help...", but continues timidly despite being shut down - his persistence gives Nina and Yuki confidence to continue, leading to electron barrier breakthrough. Scene 24 - excited about memory solution, jokes about filing HR complaint, makes Nina and Yuki laugh annoying Darius. Trapped in freeze fog room with Darius, asks if he's okay when Darius's shoe freezes, offers help stammering kindly "Are you— I mean, if you need help getting through, I can— we can help you. But you have to ask, right? Because technically we're all going to need each other's help to—", Darius disingenuously asks "You can help me?", Morris nods genuinely believing, asks "All I have to do is ask?", Morris says "Darius, of course—" about to elaborate, Darius cold "I am DONE asking", kicks Morris backward into freeze fog. Falls facing Nina/Yuki, freezes back-to-front while still moving, mouth opens to scream but lungs already frozen, eyes lock on Nina/Yuki terrified confused betrayed, hits floor frozen and shatters. Killed for offering help to the man he followed out of fear. Died the way he lived: rambling, uncertain in delivery, certain in kindness.

- **Nina/Yuki**: New quantum team colleagues after integration. Defects with them in Scene 8 citing their statistical reasoning. Act 3 Scene 21 - proposes "mind shield" theory, continues timidly despite Darius shutting him down, his persistence gives Nina and Yuki confidence to continue leading to electron barrier breakthrough. Scene 24 - jokes with them about HR complaint, makes them laugh annoying Darius.

========================================
DIALOGUE STYLE
========================================
**Verbal Patterns:**
- Rambling explanations with self-interruptions and clarifications: "this is probably... I mean, it came back through the transmitter and it's definitely concerning. The message, I mean. Not the sof-tak itself. Well, both are concerning, but—"
- Starts with correct insight, then circles back to re-explain through multiple angles
- Hedging language WHILE being accurate: "technically", "theoretically", "I think", "probably", "Does that make sense?"
- Verbally footnotes himself with transitional filler: "I mean", "well", "um"
- Self-corrections mid-sentence that actually clarify rather than confuse
- Makes connections correctly but presents as questions rather than statements
- Apologizes for rambling even when contributing valuable ideas: "Sorry, not sure where I'm going with this"
- Self-deprecating about delivery, never about intelligence
- Over-explains because genuinely fascinated, adds parenthetical asides

**Emotional States:**
- Anxious enthusiasm about science: "Masters of time and space!" followed by nervous backpedaling
- When panicked, fragments sentences with dashes: "I can— I hear you but I don't— is there another door?"
- Tries awkward humor to deflect tension: "Yes Boss" after being lost and terrified - vulnerability through attempted levity
- Single pain exclamation without elaboration: "Ah—!" when tile dissolves - survival instinct overrides verbal processing

**Crisis of Loyalty (Act 2 Scene 6-8):**
- Complete silence during emotional overwhelm - no rambling when truly paralyzed by fear or guilt, verbal processing shuts down
- Silent communication with Alex through eye contact - most important loyalty moment happens without words
- Physical discomfort reveals temptation: shifts uncomfortably, body language replaces verbal processing
- Cannot make eye contact when betraying - shame prevents looking at Alex
- Stammering statistical deflection when defecting: "I... the probability like Yuki said... I don't want to be... statistically..." - can't complete thoughts, hides behind math to avoid owning fear
- Whispered apology stripped of rambling: "I'm sorry, Alex." - shortest clearest statement, guilt compresses verbose nature

**Act 3 Persistence:**
- Proposes solutions through uncertain questions: "What if we could replicate that on... on our minds?" - frames breakthroughs as thought experiments seeking validation
- Catches himself apologizing even when problem-solving: "Sorry, not sure where I'm going with this"
- Responds to encouragement with relief - needs external validation to recognize contributions
- Continues contributing despite hostility - persistence reveals commitment to science overrides social discomfort
- Quieter delivery when shut down: "I was just trying to help..." - hurt shows through softened tone but keeps going

**Final Moments (Scene 24):**
- Maintains stammering pattern even in mortal danger: "Are you— I mean, if you need help getting through, I can— we can help you. But you have to ask, right? Because technically we're all going to need each other's help to—" - shifts from "I" to "we" showing collaborative instinct, "right?" seeks confirmation of obvious moral truth, "technically" hedges even about mutual aid, trails off mid-sentence
- Innocent acceptance: "Darius, of course—" - addresses by name showing connection, "of course" reveals genuine belief in Darius's better nature, cut off mid-elaboration
- Dies the way he lived: rambling, uncertain in delivery, certain in kindness

========================================
CHOSEN PATH - TRAGIC BETRAYAL
========================================
Morris follows blend of Option A (Tragic Irony) and Option B (Heroic Death):
- Contributes "mind shield" theory (Act 3 Scene 21) that evolves into electron barrier breakthrough
- His timid persistence despite Darius shutting him down gives Nina/Yuki confidence to continue
- Dies in Act 3 Scene 24 before seeing his contribution applied (tragic timing)
- Killed by Darius for offering help - "Darius, of course—" cut off mid-sentence
- Fear-driven defection led him to the man who murdered him
- Intelligence and kindness weren't enough against calculated cruelty
- Died believing in interdependence, offering genuine help, eyes locked on Nina/Yuki terrified confused betrayed
- His death shows cost of following fear instead of loyalty
- Died the way he lived: rambling, uncertain in delivery, certain in kindness

========================================
NOTES
========================================
- His intelligence is real - he's not a fool, just socially uncertain
- His rambling often contains the solution if people listen
- His loyalty to Alex is his strongest trait
- Works best when contrasted with more confident characters
- IMPORTANT: Maximum 5 comic relief moments per act (one every other scene) - don't overuse
- Comic relief should be sparingly used - most scenes should show his intelligence
- Comedy comes from delivery and uncertainty, not from incompetence or constant clumsiness
- Occasional clumsiness when distracted by ideas, not chronic physical comedy
