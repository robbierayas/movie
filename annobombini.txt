I want to focus on pure comedy. It will be that atomic war destroyed governments but people survived and animals are transformed. Is there anything like that

Surveyed genre combinations and identified scarcity of pure comedies.




Your concept is pretty unique! Here's what exists with similar elements:

Closest matches:

Tank Girl (1995) - Post-apocalyptic comedy after comet destroys earth, features mutant kangaroo-human hybrids called "Rippers" as supporting characters. Anarchic, punk rock vibe. Budget: $25M.

Love and Monsters (2020) - This is the CLOSEST to what you're describing. Rockets destroyed an asteroid but dumped chemicals that mutated insects and non-mammalian animals into giant monsters. Humans live in underground bunkers.
Chronically Streaming
 But it's more adventure/romance than pure comedy. Budget: $30M.

Zombeavers (2014) - Horror-comedy with mutant zombie beavers. Small scale, R-rated. Budget: ~$1M.

What DOESN'T exist:

A pure comedy (not horror-comedy, not action-adventure) set in a post-nuclear world with:

Governments collapsed
Transformed animals as major element
Survivors trying to rebuild
This is genuinely fresh territory for comedy! Most post-apocalyptic mutant animal films lean horror (Eight Legged Freaks, Night of the Lepus) or action (Rampage).

Why this could work as comedy:

You could play it like:

Office politics but post-apocalypse - survivors trying to form committees, elect leaders, deal with HOA-style petty disputes while mutant squirrels attack
What We Do in the Shadows tone but survivors instead of vampires
Parks and Recreation meets Mad Max
People trying to maintain pre-war normalcy ("Karen still wants to speak to a manager even though there ARE no managers")
Budget considerations:

Depends entirely on how you handle the animals:

Practical creature suits/puppets: $15-25M
Heavy VFX creatures: $30-50M
Mostly implied/off-screen + comedy focus: $3-8M (like Zombeavers)
The smart low-budget approach:

Keep mutant animals mostly off-screen or in shadows
Focus on human comedy of rebuilding society
One or two "signature" creatures done practically
Small cast, limited locations (one settlement/compound)
Is this for contained location comedy or bigger scope?

They will go on adventures. It will start with them at home to go on a hunt that reveals something that requires a big trip to somewhere


Synthesized quest structure with budget considerations and comparable references.






Ah, so it's a quest/road trip comedy structure. That changes the budget significantly because you'll need:

Multiple locations
Travel sequences (vehicles in post-apocalyptic condition)
Different creature encounters along the route
Various survivor communities/settlements they pass through
Budget Reality Check:

With multiple locations + road trip + creatures, you're looking at $8-15M minimum for something that looks decent. Here's why:

Cost drivers:

Multiple location shoots (travel logistics, permits, different set dressing)
Vehicles (post-apocalyptic cars/bikes/trucks + maintenance/stunt drivers)
Creature effects at EACH location
Larger cast (different communities = more actors)
Comparable road trip comedies:

Zombieland (2009): $23M - horror-comedy road trip with creatures
Due Date (2010): $65M - but star-heavy
We're the Millers (2013): $37M - road trip comedy
Dumb and Dumber (1994): $17M (would be ~$35M today)
How to keep YOUR version affordable ($5-10M range):

1. Limit creature variety Make 2-3 "hero creatures" that appear throughout:

One small mutant (puppet/animatronic, travels with them)
One medium threat (practical suit actor)
One big set-piece creature (combination practical + VFX)
Reuse these designs in different contexts rather than creating new creatures at every stop.

2. Strategic location choices

Shoot in one region (Southwest = deserts, abandoned buildings, varied terrain within driving distance)
Mix: established film-friendly towns + public land
Use New Mexico/Utah/Arizona - tons of post-apocalyptic locations, cheap, crew-friendly
3. Vehicle strategy

Make the journey on foot/bikes for most of it (cheaper)
ONE hero vehicle they find/repair mid-journey
Practical junker cars are way cheaper than CGI
4. Community structure Instead of many small settlements, do:

Home base (1-2 locations)
The journey (mostly wilderness/ruins)
Destination settlement (2-3 locations)
Maybe ONE mid-point stop
Story Structure Examples:

Act 1: Home settlement (10-15 min)

Establish normal life post-apocalypse
Comedy in how they've adapted
Hunt goes wrong, discover map/message/clue
Act 2A: Journey begins (20-25 min)

Leave safety, first creature encounters
Meet weird survivors along the way
Comedy from culture shock between settlements
Acquire the vehicle/companion animal
Act 2B: Complications (20-25 min)

Journey gets harder
Big creature set piece
Character conflicts
Discover the truth is different than expected
Act 3: Destination + resolution (20-25 min)

Reach the place
Final creature/human confrontation
Resolution that sets up potential sequel
Tone References for Pure Comedy:

The World's End - comedy that happens to have sci-fi elements
Galaxy Quest - genuine comedy, not parody
Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure - goofy but earnest
Hunt for the Wilderpeople - adventure comedy with heart
Key Question:

Is the comedy:

Broad/slapstick (dumb but lovable heroes, physical comedy)
Deadpan/dry (characters take apocalypse seriously, comedy comes from absurdity)
Satirical (poking fun at how people would actually behave)
This affects casting, budget, and marketability. Broad comedy might need recognizable comedic actors ($$$), while deadpan can work with unknowns.

What's your comedy style, and how many people in the main group traveling?

Mix of slapstick and dry. Dumb and dumber and galaxy quest and cabin boy and idiocracy and harold and kumar are inspiration. I don't really care about vfx limits at this point. It could be two idiot guys a girl and a "billy bumbler" racoon thing. Throughout they are running into other people surviving telling funny story


Validated concept and mapped comedy structure opportunities.





Okay NOW we're cooking! This combo actually has real potential. Let me break down why this works and how to maximize it:

Why This Concept Works:

The Idiocracy/Harold & Kumar model = dumb protagonists stumbling through a world that's ALSO dumb, creating double comedy
Post-apocalypse removes all social rules = license for maximum absurdity
The raccoon sidekick = physical comedy + can't talk back to correct their stupidity
Episodic survivor encounters = anthology-style comedy beats, each settlement has different joke rhythm
Character Dynamic (Critical):

You need contrast between your three humans:

Option A - Classic Trio:

Guy 1: Confident idiot (thinks he's the leader, always wrong)
Guy 2: Anxious idiot (knows they're screwed, follows anyway)
Girl: Smart but stuck with them (the "straight man" but also makes bad decisions)
Option B - All Idiots:

Guy 1: Overconfident dumbass
Guy 2: Stoner-logic dumbass
Girl: Different flavor of dumbass (like Lloyd vs Harry - both stupid differently)
I'd lean Option A - the girl needs to be the audience POV who also gets dragged into their stupidity. Think Marge Gunderson in Fargo but in an idiotic adventure.

The Raccoon ("Billy Bumbler"):

This is actually brilliant because:

Can repeat last word of sentences (creates comedic callbacks/misunderstandings)
Physical comedy without dialogue
Emotional anchor (they protect it, it saves them)
Can be practical puppetry + minimal CGI for action scenes
Story Structure - "Idiot's Journey":

ACT 1 - The Home Settlement (10-15 min) Establish the post-apocalypse is stupid:

Government committee that accomplishes nothing
Weird new religions/cults forming
People farming mutant vegetables, complaining about HOA rules
Our heroes are the town's "hunters" (worst possible choice)
Inciting Incident: During hunt, they find:

A functioning GPS/map device pointing somewhere
A radio transmission from a "salvation" location
A mysterious person/creature who tells them about something important elsewhere
The settlement leader (idiot authority figure) insists THEY go because "you found it."

ACT 2A - Early Journey (20-25 min)

First Settlement: Preppers who prepared for wrong apocalypse

Stocked for zombies, got mutant animals instead
Have useless supplies (zombie defense kits, gas masks for virus)
Leader explains their "brilliant" failed survival plan
Comic set piece: heroes accidentally release their contained mutant
Second Encounter: Lone survivor with elaborate trap/fortress

Clearly insane from isolation
Spent years building defense against creatures that don't exist in area
Long monologue about their journey (funny flashback?)
Has one piece of info about the destination
Raccoon joins: Found injured, they "rescue" it (it's fine, they make it worse)

ACT 2B - Mid Journey Complications (25-30 min)

Third Settlement: Cargo cult around old technology

Worshipping a dead Roomba or Alexa
Elaborate rituals to make it work
"Priests" who interpret its (non-existent) messages
They need to "consult the oracle" - heroes accidentally break it
Chase scene/escape
Fourth Encounter: Rival idiot group on same quest

Mirror versions of our heroes
Equally stupid but different flavor
Reluctant team-up for one obstacle
They betray each other (both sides fail at betrayal)
Vehicle acquired: Find/steal/win something ridiculous to travel in

Big creature set piece: Practical stunt + VFX showcase

ACT 3 - Destination & Truth (20-25 min)

They reach the destination and discover:

Option A: It's just another group of idiots who sent out signal asking for help
Option B: It's actually something valuable, but they break it immediately
Option C: It's a functioning pre-war facility, but run by biggest idiots yet
Final confrontation isn't violence - it's them solving a problem through stupidity that accidentally works (like Galaxy Quest - dumb luck saves the day)

Resolution: They return home as "heroes," nothing learned, ready for next dumb adventure

Comedy Opportunities - Survivors' Stories:

Make each settlement's backstory a mini-comedy bit:

"How We Survived" Stories:

Guy who survived because he was in a sensory deprivation tank during the blast
Family that thought it was elaborate prank show for first 3 months
Doomsday prepper who had WRONG date, wasn't home when it happened
Person who survived because they were so boring the universe forgot about them
"How We're Rebuilding Civilization" Stories:

Trying to elect president (2 people, 50-50 tied vote for 7 years)
Recreating Taco Bell from memory (terribly wrong)
Teaching kids history from half-remembered movies
Enforcing traffic laws despite no cars
R-Rated Comedy Comps:

Since you're pulling from R-rated territory:

Pineapple Express: $27M budget
This Is The End: $32M budget
Step Brothers: $65M (but star salaries)
Hot Fuzz: $12M (action-comedy, great reference)
The Realistic Budget Path:

Phase 1: Script + Package ($50-150K):

Get script tight
Attach comedy director with track record
Create concept art for raccoon + key creatures
Create sizzle reel/proof of concept
Phase 2: Financing ($8-15M target): With Dumb and Dumber/Harold & Kumar vibe, you can pitch to:

New Line (Harold & Kumar home)
A24 (if you weird it up)
Netflix/Amazon (built-in audience)
Critical Development Questions:

Rating: R-rated or PG-13? (R gives you more comedy freedom but limits audience)
Tone: How much heart? (Galaxy Quest has emotional core, D&D is pure stupid)
Sequel potential: Is this world you want to return to?
What's the MacGuffin they're searching for? That's the key to the whole plot - needs to be something that sounds important but reveals itself to be stupid/ironic.

Heart doesn't matter. Everyone will survive and any deaths are comedic.
Idk for now i think a unlimited power source and when they find it is the people worshipping the nuke deep underground. They offer to break some off but team gets out of there and watch the tunnel collapse when it explodes. Then go home


Validated dark comedy structure and refined narrative mechanics.





PERFECT. That's a genuine dark comedy punchline. The whole quest is pointless, they make things worse, and they learn nothing. I love it.

Why This Ending Works:

Subverts the hero's journey - they don't save anyone, they kill people
The cult chose stupidity - they're worshipping a nuke, so it's cosmic justice not tragedy
Heroes escape through dumb luck - not skill, just happened to leave at right moment
Visual comedy payoff - watching from distance as mushroom cloud goes up
Return home with nothing - complete failure presented as success
Refining the Nuke Cult Scene:

Make them AGGRESSIVELY stupid so the explosion is cathartic:

The Underground Bunker:

They've built elaborate temple around the warhead
"High Priest" interprets the ticking/beeping as divine messages
Rituals include touching it (explains why they're all sick/glowing)
They KNOW it's dangerous but think faith protects them
Previous pilgrims came, were warned, also tried to take piece, also died
The Heroes' Interaction:

Cult explains it's "eternal flame that never dims"
Heroes: "That's a bomb"
Cult: "No it's blessed energy!"
Heroes: "It literally says 'WARHEAD' on the side"
Cult: "That's the god's name!"
The "Break Off A Piece" Scene: This is your big comedy set piece:

They try to carefully chip at it with hand tools
Cult members casually working around it like it's normal
Raccoon keeps trying to stop them (only smart one)
Girl realizes this is bad idea, guys ignore her
They accidentally hit the wrong thing
Calm mechanical voice: "Detonation sequence initiated. 60 seconds."
Cult: "Oh that's new! The god speaks!"
Heroes run, cult stays to witness "the blessing"
The Escape:

Slapstick sprint through tunnels
Bumping into cult members who won't leave
Raccoon leading the way
They burst out of tunnel entrance
Dove behind rocks
Beat of silence
Girl: "Maybe it was a f—"
MASSIVE EXPLOSION
The Return Home:

After the mushroom cloud, have them spin it completely:

Option A - Lie About Success:

They return claiming they "delivered the message" to the other settlement
Town celebrates them
They're heroes for doing literally nothing
End credits: radio chatter from other settlements asking about the explosion
Option B - Honest Idiots:

They explain exactly what happened
Town: "So you killed a whole settlement?"
Guy 1: "Well, they were gonna die anyway. That bomb was really unstable."
Guy 2: "Yeah we probably extended their lives by NOT taking a piece sooner."
Town somehow accepts this logic
Option C - New Quest (Sequel Hook):

They return, explosion visible in distance
Town leader: "Good news! Another signal came in..."
Heroes groan, raccoon chatters angrily
Hard cut to black
The Comedy Tone Reference:

This ending is very "Burn After Reading" by the Coen Brothers:

Everybody's an idiot
Catastrophic consequences played for laughs
Authority figures equally clueless
No lessons learned
CIA superior: "What did we learn?"
Other CIA guy: "I don't know sir."
Superior: "I don't fucking know either. I guess we learned not to do it again."
Your version:

Town leader: "What did you find?"
Hero: "Unlimited power source."
Leader: "Did you bring it back?"
Hero: "It wasn't portable."
Leader: "So what happened?"
Hero: "It... relocated. Upward. Rapidly."
Building To This Payoff:

You need to seed throughout the journey that:

Every settlement they visit is also doomed by their own stupidity (so the nuke cult isn't unique)
The heroes consistently make things worse (so it's their pattern, not one-time thing)
The raccoon is always right but ignored (so there was a voice of reason)
Examples of earlier "making it worse":

First settlement: They accidentally release the mutant, it eats their food supply
Second settlement: They break their water filtration trying to "fix" it
Third settlement: They reveal their oracle is fake, causing civil war
Vehicle scene: They "borrow" someone's only transportation
So by the time they blow up the nuke cult, the audience is primed for them to fuck everything up.

The Dark Comedy Balance:

The cult needs to be:

Warned multiple times (they chose this)
Given chances to leave (they refused)
Clearly beyond help (they're already dying from radiation)
Annoying enough (so we don't feel bad)
The explosion shouldn't show bodies - just the mushroom cloud from a distance, our heroes' faces lit by the blast, then maybe a "Welp" moment.

One More Thing:

Consider having them see the mushroom cloud reflected in the raccoon's eyes, hold on its knowing expression, then:

Raccoon: "Idiots."
Guy 1: "Did he just—?"
Guy 2: "Nah."
Girl: "Definitely said idiots."
Raccoon: "Idiots."

First time it talks clearly, just to call them out.

Does the journey have any recurring antagonists (rival idiot group) or is it purely episodic encounters?
