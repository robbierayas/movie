5. **The Smart Home Malfunction**
   - Automated house turned into death trap
   - Victim killed by their own luxury appliances
   - Geoff controls everything from tablet while dining
   - "Alexa, eliminate the problem"

### Horrific Deaths
6. **The Trash Compactor**

   - Slow, mechanical, inevitable
   - Victim fully conscious, screaming
   - Geoff watches through window, bored

7. **The Freezer Walk-In**
   - Locked in industrial freezer
   - Slow hypothermia death over hours
   - Geoff checks in periodically via camera
   - Body frozen solid, difficult to transport

8. **The Chemical Shower**
   - Industrial "decontamination" shower
   - Wrong chemicals pumped in
   - Skin melts off, body liquefies
   - Geoff "accidentally" hit wrong button
   - Remains hard to collect/transport

9. **The Drone Strike**
   - Victim hunted by small assassination drone
   - Runs through warehouse/building
   - Eventually caught and killed
   - Practice run for the finale's mass gassing

10. **The Moosk Special** (Scene 6)
    - Victim held by wrist restraints from ceiling
    - Geoff punching weakly (not physically strong)
    - Moosk has been doing the real damage with inhuman strength
    - Victim already dead or dies during scene
    - Geoff tells Moosk to get him down
    - Hands break sickeningly as Moosk lowers the body
    - Body looks normal enough for Scene 7 transport
    - Shows dynamic: Moosk kills, Geoff watches/participates weakly
    - No emotion from Moosk, just efficiency

### Mix of Both
11. **The Elevator "Accident"**
    - Cable cut, long fall
    - Geoff in penthouse above, listening on intercom
    - Makes victim sing for their life on the way down
    - Mess at bottom is catastrophic

12. **The Pool Party Gone Wrong**
    - Weighted down in infinity pool
    - Party continues around the body
    - Nobody notices/cares
    - Adam has to fish it out during event

13. **The Art Installation**
    - Body posed as part of modern art exhibit
    - Geoff's party guests walk by it for hours
    - "How avant-garde!"
    - Adam must steal it back before it's discovered

## Disposal Challenges & Near-Misses

**IMPORTANT NOTES:**
- All cars are auto-pilot vehicles (self-driving)
- Geoff arranges for Adam to have free use of Amazing Company auto-cars during disposal
- Adam CANNOT drive directly to his disposal spot (too obvious/risky)
- Must use creative intermediate stops and misdirection
- Tone: Breaking Bad style - very tense suspense with close getaway OR comedic (not slapstick)

### Act 1 - Learning the Ropes

**Job 1: The Police Stop** (Scene 6)
- Transporting body in Amazing Company auto-car at night
- Night police stop the auto-car (routine check or traffic stop) saying people have gone missing recently

- Night police ask what he's doing in auto-car
- Adam claims he was offered a job by Amazing Company and this is a perk
- Night police suspicious, ask to see inside

- Night police are satisfied and congratulate him on new job
- CLOSE CALL: Heart pounding, nearly caught

**Job 2: The Homeless Camp Witness** (Scene 16 - TENSE)

- Passenger says head moved weird thought he was dead
- Reaches toward body, Adam desperately checks jugular pulse and says yeah hes alive
- Adam adjusts body by pulling knees forward so head shifts back
- Head moves to resting position with hard smack, both pause
- Adam ventriloquizes the body snoring then laughs and passenger laughs
- Adam says he sounds ok but maybe they'll change to go to an urgent care
- Passenger gets dropped off early, clearly creeped out
- COMEDIC: Dark humor of awkward conversation while hiding body
- TENSE: Could fall apart any second if passenger investigates

**Job 4: The Checkpoint Scan** (Scene 9 - TENSE SUSPENSE)
- Transporting body in Amazing Company auto-car through city
- Auto-car's route optimization takes him through Standard class district

- Security system flags mismatch, begins scanning cargo
- Body wrapped but dense organic material shows on scanner
- Adam must quickly claim he's an Amazing Company employee (Geoff gave him fake ID/credentials)
- Frantically enters employee codes Geoff provided
- System processes... pauses... accepts credentials at last second
- Barrier lifts, auto-car proceeds

- Shows the risk of the arrangement and Geoff's power

**Job 5: The Almost Busted** (Scene 12)
- Adam and Geoff at disposal location with body
- Night police show up unexpectedly (possibly tipped off or routine patrol)
- Body is visible on couch/furniture
- Night police recognize Geoff, don't fully approach
- Police see the dead body but know what kind of trouble Geoff will get them into
- Don't intend to do anything but can't just leave either
- Geoff forces Adam to pretend to make out with the body to hide it
- Adam and police both grossed out but continue charade out of fear
- Police eventually leave (choosing to ignore what they saw)
- TENSE AND HORRIFYING: Shows Geoff's power and Adam's degradation

### Act 2 - Getting Sloppy

**Job 6: The Public Kill** (Scene 15)
- Geoff kills someone in increasingly public location
- Cameras everywhere, many witnesses
- Adam told to "figure it out"
- Has to hide body, wraps it in a rope in tight position for rigor mortis to set in and make it small
- Comes back with a large box
- All of body fits except a hand, has to break rigor mortis, during hand breaks off

## BAD IDEAS (Removed from Active List)

**The Parking Garage** (Originally Job 1)
- Security guard patrol too close
- Adam hides body in own shopping cart disguise
- Guard asks him for directions
- Body's arm falls out, Adam shoves it back in
- Creates chemical smoke bomb distraction
*Why removed: Shopping cart doesn't fit with auto-car transport system*

**The Public Transit** (Originally Job 3)
- Body hidden in large shipping crate
- Must take it on subway during rush hour
- Crate starts leaking glowing liquid
- Adam claims it's "art supplies" - phosphorescent paint
- Hipster passengers are actually interested
- Has to give fake art lecture while body decomposes inside
*Why removed: Doesn't fit with Amazing Company auto-car access*

**The Waste Full** (Originally Job 5)
- Disposal site nearly full of glowing sludge
- Body won't fit in remaining space
- Adam has to fold/compress body in horrifying way
- Sludge overflows, burns his hand
- Realizes he's running out of room
*Why removed: Should be ongoing tension, not single scene moment*

**The Still-Alive Problem** (Originally Job 7)
- Geoff's victim isn't quite dead yet
- Weakly pleading during transport
- Adam has moral crisis
- Geoff forces him to finish it
- Adam's first time actually killing someone
*Why removed: Too dark/moral crisis better shown other ways*

**The Witness Problem** (Originally Job 8)
- Someone sees Adam at disposal site
- Adam has to chase them down
- Doesn't kill them, but threatens them
- Person is also homeless, understands survival
- Uneasy truce, but tension builds
*Why removed: Disposal site should be secret - witnessing breaks that*

## Notes on Tone

- Deaths should range from darkly funny to genuinely disturbing
- Geoff treats killing like a hobby - bored rich person behavior
- Disposal challenges show Adam's intelligence and resourcefulness
- Near-misses build tension and show consequences approaching
- Scams show community bonding and Robin Hood element
- Contrast between petty scams ($20-200) and body disposal money ($5,000+)
- Scams are victimless fun compared to what Adam's really doing
- T and Gal don't know about the body disposal at first
- Scams are how Adam integrates into Tracktown community
- Money from Geoff vs. money from scams = guilty vs. innocent income
