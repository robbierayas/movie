# Scene 14 - The Almost Busted

## LOCATION
EXT. WAREHOUSE DISTRICT - NIGHT

## CHARACTERS
Adam, Geoff, Moosk, Night Police Officers, Body (victim)

## SCENE LAYOUT

### Opening
Adam arrives at an abandoned warehouse to retrieve a body. The victim is slumped on an old couch/furniture, positioned
casually as if sleeping. Geoff is there, relaxed, walking around and even sitting on the couch near the body like it's
nothing. Moosk stands nearby. Adam is trying to figure out how to move the body when they hear footsteps approaching.

### Key Beats
1. **Police Arrive** - Night police officers enter the warehouse, flashlights sweeping. They're doing a routine patrol or
responding to a call. They freeze when they see Geoff.
2. **Recognition** - The police recognize Geoff immediately. Their body language changes - they become cautious,
uncertain. They don't approach fully.
3. **The Body** - It becomes clear to the police that the person on the couch is dead, not sleeping. But they also know
what kind of trouble Geoff can cause for them if they interfere.
4. **The Improvisation** - Geoff, thinking quickly, forces Adam to pretend to make out with the body to hide what it is.
Adam has no choice but to comply.
5. **The Charade** - Adam and the police are both horrified and disgusted, but Adam continues the act out of fear. The
police play along because they're afraid of Geoff's power and influence.
6. **They Leave** - The police choose to leave, pretending they saw nothing. They know the truth but won't act on it.

### Character Moments
- **Adam**: Experiences complete degradation. Forced to kiss a corpse to maintain Geoff's cover. His horror and revulsion
are genuine, but fear of Geoff (and Moosk) keeps him compliant. This is a new low.
- **Geoff**: Demonstrates his power over both Adam and the police. Casual and confident even when caught. Knows the
police won't touch him. Uses Adam as a disposable tool without hesitation.
- **Police**: Caught between duty and self-preservation. Recognize Geoff, know they can't win against his wealth and
power. Choose to walk away rather than get involved.
- **Moosk**: Silent enforcer whose presence reminds everyone of the physical threat backing Geoff's power.

### Closing
The police leave. Adam pulls away from the body, sickened and shaking. Geoff laughs it off - just another close call, no
big deal. Adam realizes there's no limit to how low Geoff will force him to go. The system itself protects Geoff. No one
will save Adam.

## FULL SCRIPT

INT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

Broken windows let moonlight streak across the dusty floor. Old furniture scattered around - forgotten office space
turned storage dump.

An old COUCH sits against the wall.

Slumped on it: a BODY. Male, thirties, positioned as if sleeping. Eyes closed. Head tilted back.

Geoff stands nearby, casual, hands in pockets. He walks around the couch, examining it like furniture shopping.

                    GEOFF
          Heh-heh. Comfortable, actually.

He sits down ON THE COUCH. Right next to the body.

                    GEOFF (CONT'D)
          Not bad. Someone left decent stuff here.

Moosk stands in the shadows, motionless. Red eyes glowing.

The warehouse door creaks open.

Adam enters, flashlight sweeping. He spots Geoff on the couch next to the corpse.

                    ADAM
          Jesus. Are you sitting on--

                    GEOFF
          Tested it. Solid frame. Springs are shot but--

Adam, cutting him off.

                    ADAM
          Can you not?

Geoff stands, brushing off his pants.

                    GEOFF
          Touchy. It's just furniture.

                    ADAM
          There's a dead person on it.

                    GEOFF
          Well, yes. That's why you're here.

Adam approaches the body, studying the best way to move it.

                    ADAM
          How long ago?

                    GEOFF
          Two hours? Three?

                    ADAM
          Fresh. That's something.

                    ADAM (CONT'D)
          Rigor hasn't set. I can get him in the car without--

Adam grabs the body by the shoulders. Starts dragging it toward the couch.

VOICES outside. Footsteps.

They all freeze.

Geoff, quietly.

                    GEOFF
          You expecting company?

                    ADAM
          No.

The footsteps get closer.

FLASHLIGHT BEAMS sweep through the broken windows.

Geoff, urgent.

                    GEOFF
          Sit. Now. Back toward the door.

                    ADAM
          What?

                    GEOFF
          DO IT.

Adam scrambles onto the couch. Pulls the body up beside him. Positions the body's back toward the entrance.

OFFICER REEVES (O.S.)
...checked this place last week. Kids keep breaking in.

OFFICER NASH (O.S.)
Pain in the ass.

The warehouse door swings open.

Two POLICE OFFICERS enter: REEVES (40s, weathered) and NASH (late 20s, by-the-book).

Their flashlights hit Geoff first.

Both officers stop.

                    OFFICER REEVES
          Oh. Mr.--

Geoff, friendly.

                    GEOFF
          Officers. Evening.

The flashlights sweep across Moosk, then--

Adam on the couch. Sitting beside someone with their back to the cops.

Officer Nash's light lingers on the figure. Can't see the face. Just the back of their head, body slumped against Adam.

                    OFFICER NASH
          Sir, is your friend alright?

Geoff, following the flashlight.

                    GEOFF
          Hmm? Oh. He's fine. Just tired.

                    OFFICER NASH
          He looks--

Officer reeves, quiet warning.

                    OFFICER REEVES
          Nash.

Nash looks at his partner. Reeves stares at Geoff, face unreadable.

The silence stretches.

Reeves knows. Nash is starting to realize.

                    OFFICER REEVES (CONT'D)
          We got a call about trespassers. You gentlemen have business here?

                    GEOFF
          Just looking at furniture. Friend of mine is moving.
          (gestures to Adam)
          Needed a couch.

                    OFFICER NASH
          At midnight?

                    GEOFF
          Best time. No crowds.

Nash's flashlight drifts back to the body.

                    OFFICER NASH
          Sir, your friend hasn't moved since we got here. Is he--

Officer reeves, louder, cutting him off.

                    OFFICER REEVES
          Nash. Outside. Now.

                    OFFICER NASH
          But--

                    OFFICER REEVES
          Now.

Reeves grabs Nash's arm, pulling him toward the door.

Nash resists, staring at the body.

                    OFFICER NASH
          There's something wrong. Look at--

Geoff, calm, dangerous.

                    GEOFF
          Officer Nash, was it?

Nash freezes.

                    GEOFF (CONT'D)
          I appreciate your diligence. But as you can see, we're just furniture shopping. My friend here is resting. Long
          day.

                    OFFICER NASH
          He's not breathing.

The words hang in the air.

Geoff doesn't flinch.

                    GEOFF
          You sure about that?

Moosk shifts. Just slightly. A reminder of his presence.

Nash swallows hard.

Officer reeves, firm.

                    OFFICER REEVES
          He's breathing. We can see from here. Right, Nash?

Nash hesitates, staring at the figure on the couch.

                    OFFICER NASH
          I should check. Welfare--

He takes a step toward the couch.

Geoff, smooth, improvising.

                    GEOFF
          Oh, they're just... you know. Young love.
          (to Adam)
          Kiss him. Now.

Adam's head snaps toward Geoff.

                    ADAM
          What?

Geoff smiles.

                    GEOFF
          True love's kiss. Classic.

                    ADAM
          No.

                    GEOFF
          No?

Moosk's hand moves to his side. Ready.

Adam, panicking.

                    ADAM
          Geoff, I can't--

                    GEOFF
          Sure you can. You love him. Don't you?

Tears well in Adam's eyes.

Geoff (cont'd) turns to police.

                    GEOFF (CONT'D)
          They're very affectionate.

Adam looks at the corpse beside him.

Pale. Lips blue.

Dead.

He has to kiss a dead person.

Adam, quietly.

                    ADAM
          Please...

                    GEOFF
          Adam.

The name is a command.

Adam leans forward.

His face inches from the corpse.

The smell hits him. Early decomposition. Bodily fluids releasing.

He gags, catches himself.

The police look away. Nash's face goes green.

Adam closes his eyes.

Presses his lips against the corpse's mouth.

Cold. Rigid. Wrong.

He pulls back immediately, gasping.

Adam, forced cheerfulness.

                    ADAM
          There. See? He's fine. Just tired.

Geoff smiles.

                    GEOFF
          Adorable.

Officer Nash looks like he might vomit.

                    OFFICER REEVES
          We should go.

Officer nash, horrified.

                    OFFICER NASH
          Are you serious? They--

                    OFFICER REEVES
          We're leaving. Now.

                    GEOFF
          Thank you, officers. For checking in. Very professional.

Reeves drags Nash toward the door.

                    OFFICER NASH
          This is insane! There's a dead body--

Officer reeves, low, fierce.

                    OFFICER REEVES
          You want to end up like him? Shut. Up.

They reach the door.

Nash takes one last look back.

Adam sits beside the corpse, shaking. Geoff stands behind the couch, smiling.

Moosk's red eyes track them.

The door slams.

Their footsteps fade.

Silence.

Adam lurches off the couch, stumbling away.

He dry heaves. Nothing comes up.

                    GEOFF
          Heh-heh-heh. That was close.

Adam shakes their head.

                    ADAM
          You made me--

                    GEOFF
          I saved us. You're welcome.

                    ADAM
          I KISSED A CORPSE!

                    GEOFF
          And now the police think he's your boyfriend. Clever, right?

Adam wipes his mouth frantically with his sleeve. Again. Again.

                    ADAM
          They knew. They saw--

                    GEOFF
          And they left. Because they know better.
          (casual)
          That's the thing about power, Adam. It's not about what you can buy. It's about what people won't do.

Geoff heads for the door.

                    GEOFF (CONT'D)
          Moosk will help you load him. Clean yourself up first. You've got... residue.

He gestures vaguely at Adam's face.

Adam touches his lips. They're wet.

Fluid from the corpse.

He vomits. Actually vomits this time.

Geoff's titter laugh echoes as he leaves.

Geoff (CONT'D, O.S.)
Heh-heh-heh.

Adam kneels on the floor, heaving.

Moosk approaches the couch. Lifts the body effortlessly.

Waits for Adam to recover.

Adam spits. Wipes his face.

Stares at the wet sleeve.

Adam, broken.

                    ADAM
          What am I...

Moosk stands silent. Holding the corpse.

Waiting.

Adam gets to his feet.

Opens the door.

They carry the body to the auto-car.

Just another job.

Just another degradation.

Just another piece of his soul gone.

FADE OUT.
