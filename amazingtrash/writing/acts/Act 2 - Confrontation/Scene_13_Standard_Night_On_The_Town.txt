# Scene 13 - Standard Night on the Town

## LOCATION
INT. LUXURY RESTAURANT / CASINO / CASINO HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

## CHARACTERS
Adam, Geoff, Moosk, Nicole (victim)

## SCENE LAYOUT

### Opening
Geoff summons Adam for a "Standard night on the town" - ostensibly to help him relax after the paranoia from Scene 12.
Adam is suspicious but can't refuse. They arrive at an upscale steakhouse, the kind of place Adam would never enter on
his own. Geoff is perfectly comfortable. Moosk stands silently in the background.

### Key Beats
1. **The Restaurant** - Expensive steaks arrive. Geoff casually dismisses the $1,000 meal as "mid." Adam, who's been
surviving on scraps, is shocked by both the quality and Geoff's dismissal of it.
2. **The Casino** - They move to the casino floor. Geoff gambles thousands on craps like it's nothing. Adam nervously
asks for extra money for "supplies" - $2,500, which seems huge to him but is loose change compared to the casino
chips Geoff is throwing around.
3. **Getting Drunk** - As the night progresses, Adam drinks more. He loosens up, starts to enjoy himself. When Geoff
loses big, Adam jokes "mid" using Geoff's slang, mimicking him. They both laugh. For a moment, it almost feels like friendship.
4. **"She's Mid"** - A woman (Nicole) approaches the craps table. Drunk Adam jokes to Geoff "she's mid." Geoff calls her
over, charms her, and invites her to his hotel suite for cocaine.
5. **The Hotel Room** - In Geoff's suite, they drink and do cocaine. As Nicole leans down for her second line, Geoff
slashes her throat with a razor blade. Adam watches in horror.
6. **The Blame** - Geoff blames Adam: "You said she was mid." Adam's drunk joke became Geoff's justification for murder.
Adam is forced to realize he's complicit - his words, his presence, his participation enabled this.
7. **The Realization** - Left alone with Nicole's body and Moosk, Adam understands the entire night was manipulation. The
steak, the money, the laughter - all designed to make him comfortable enough to become an accomplice, not just a cleaner.

### Character Moments
- **Adam**: Initially tense and suspicious, gradually relaxes with alcohol. Enjoys the luxury despite knowing it's blood
money. The moment he mimics Geoff's "mid" shows he's being corrupted/normalized to this lifestyle. When he drunkenly calls
Nicole "mid," he's just joking - but Geoff uses it as justification to kill her. Adam is forced to witness the brutal
throat-slashing and realize his words have consequences. The guilt is crushing - this one is his fault.
- **Geoff**: Performs "generosity" but reveals it's manipulation. Uses Adam's drunk joke ("she's mid") as an excuse to kill
Nicole. The razor blade attack is sudden and brutal. Geoff blames Adam: "You said she was mid" - weaponizing Adam's words
to make him complicit. The titter laugh after murder shows his complete detachment from human life.
- **Moosk**: Silent observer throughout, a constant reminder of the power dynamic even during "friendly" moments. Assists
with cleanup without emotion.

### Closing
Adam is left alone with Nicole's body in the hotel suite. Her blood soaks into the expensive carpet. He realizes the entire
night - the steak, the gambling, the drinks, the laughter - was manipulation designed to make him comfortable enough to witness
a murder and feel responsible for it. Getting him drunk was part of the plan: lower his resistance, blur his judgment. Adam
realizes he's not Geoff's partner or friend. He's a tool. A weapon. And this murder? This one's on him. His words killed her.

## FULL SCRIPT

INT. LUXURY RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Chandeliers. White tablecloths. Quiet murmur of wealthy patrons.

Adam sits rigidly at a corner table, wearing the same worn clothes he always does. He looks completely out of place.

Across from him: GEOFF, relaxed and comfortable in designer casual wear.

Behind them, standing motionless: MOOSK, hands folded, scanning the room.

A WAITER approaches with two massive steaks on fine china.

                    WAITER
          The 45-day dry-aged ribeye for both gentlemen. Enjoy.

The waiter departs. Adam stares at the steak - easily the size of his head.

                    GEOFF
          Heh-heh-heh. Go on. It's not poisoned.

Adam picks up his fork and knife. Cuts a piece. Takes a bite.

His eyes widen slightly. It's incredible.

                    GEOFF (CONT'D)
          So? What do you think?

Adam, carefully.

                    ADAM
          It's... really good.

                    GEOFF
          Mid.

Adam stops mid-chew.

                    ADAM
          What?

                    GEOFF
          The steak. It's mid. I've had better.
          (cuts his own)
          Place in Tokyo does a wagyu that'll make you cry. This? Standard fare.

Adam looks at his plate. The $1,000 steak he'll never afford again.

                    ADAM
          If you say so.

                    GEOFF
          You were rattled last night. The auto-car thing.

                    ADAM
          I'm fine.

                    GEOFF
          You're paranoid. Jumpy. That's bad for business.
          (gestures around)
          So. Night out. My treat. Relax a little.

                    ADAM
          I said I'm fine.

                    GEOFF
          Heh-heh-heh. Sure you are.

Geoff eats casually. Adam tries to do the same but can't quite manage it.

                    GEOFF (CONT'D)
          How's the community? The railyard people?

Adam's fork pauses.

                    ADAM
          Why?

                    GEOFF
          Curious. You spend my money there, right? Food, supplies.

Adam, defensive.

                    ADAM
          I contribute. That's my business.

                    GEOFF
          Didn't say it wasn't. Just making conversation.

They eat in silence. Moosk's red eyes track every movement in the restaurant.

---

INT. CASINO - NIGHT

Bright lights. Slot machine jingles. The controlled chaos of money changing hands.

Geoff, Adam, and Moosk stand at a CRAPS TABLE.

Geoff tosses three $1000 chips onto the felt.

                    GEOFF
          Hard eight.

The DEALER nods. The dice roll.

Four and four.

                    DEALER
          Eight, hard way. Winner.

The dealer slides a stack of chips to Geoff.

                    GEOFF
          Heh-heh-heh. See? Luck.

Adam holds a single $25 chip, watching the pile of money move around the table like it's monopoly bills.

                    GEOFF (CONT'D)
          You playing or spectating?

                    ADAM
          I don't... I'm not good at this.

                    GEOFF
          It's craps. No one's good at it. You just throw.

Adam hesitantly places his $25 chip on the pass line.

The dice roll. Seven. Winner.

The dealer slides two chips back to Adam. He stares at them.

Two drinks arrive - expensive scotch. Geoff downs half his immediately.

                    GEOFF (CONT'D)
          To luck.

Adam, still nervous.

                    ADAM
          To luck.

Adam sips. The alcohol burns. He's not used to quality liquor.

                    GEOFF
          So what's on your mind? You've got that look.

                    ADAM
          What look?

                    GEOFF
          The "I need something but I'm afraid to ask" look.

Adam hesitates.

                    ADAM
          I need to buy some... supplies. For the disposal process. Better acids, some equipment upgrades.

                    GEOFF
          How much?

                    ADAM
          Twenty-five hundred. Maybe. I know it's--

Geoff, waves dismissively.

                    GEOFF
          Done. Moosk will transfer it.

Moosk's eyes flash once. Acknowledgment.

Adam's phone buzzes. He checks it. $2,500 deposited.

                    ADAM
          That fast?

                    GEOFF
          I said done. Why wait?

Adam stares at his phone. Five hundred dollars appeared because Geoff waved his hand.

                    GEOFF (CONT'D)
          Anything else?

                    ADAM
          No. That's... thank you.

                    GEOFF
          Don't thank me. You're making my life easier. I'm compensating you. That's how this works.

Geoff throws another stack of chips on the table. Thousands. Lost in seconds.

He shrugs and orders another drink.

---

INT. CASINO - CRAPS TABLE - LATER

Adam is looser now. Three drinks in. Smiling.

He throws dice with more confidence. They clatter across the felt.

                    ADAM
          Come on come on... YES!

Seven. Winner again.

The dealer slides chips to him. Adam laughs - a genuine sound.

                    GEOFF
          There you go! See? You're having fun.

                    ADAM
          I might be. Little bit.

                    GEOFF
          Good. That paranoia last night was...
          (makes face)
          Uncomfortable.

                    ADAM
          I thought I was being followed.

                    GEOFF
          By who? You're a nobody. No offense.

                    ADAM
          I'm a nobody carrying chopped bodies.

                    GEOFF
          Fair point. But still. You worry too much.

Geoff tosses chips down.

                    GEOFF (CONT'D)
          Hard eight again.

The dice roll. Five and three. Eight, but not the hard way.

                    DEALER
          Eight easy. Hard eight loses.

Geoff loses $10,000. He doesn't even flinch.

                    GEOFF
          Mid. Hard eight again.

He tosses another stack of chips down. Same bet.

Adam hears that word again. "Mid." For ten thousand dollars. For a $1,000 steak.

He starts laughing.

                    GEOFF (CONT'D)
          What?

                    ADAM
          Nothing. Just... "mid."

                    GEOFF
          It is mid. Barely felt it.

                    ADAM
          Two thousand dollars. "Mid."

The absurdity of it. Adam drinks more.

                    GEOFF
          What's your point?

                    ADAM
          No point. Just funny.

Geoff studies him. Then smiles.

                    GEOFF
          Heh-heh-heh. You're drunk.

                    ADAM
          Little bit.

Adam looks at the craps table. The point marker sits on 8.

He starts to put chips on the seven, but the dealer shakes his head.

                    DEALER
          Point is eight. Can't bet seven while the point's up.

                    ADAM
          Oh. Uh... field then.

Adam puts his chips on the field. The dice roll. Nine.

He loses. Shrugs.

Geoff's hard eight bet? Also loses. He immediately bets hard eight again.

Adam wins a hundred dollars on the next roll and feels like a king.

Geoff loses five thousand more and orders another drink.

---

INT. CASINO - CRAPS TABLE - LATER (MORE)

Adam is definitely drunk now. Leaning on the table for balance.

The dealer rolls. Five. Geoff wanted seven.

Adam, mimicking Geoff's tone.

                    ADAM
          Mid roll. Weak.

Geoff looks at him.

Adam realizes what he just did. His smile falters.

But Geoff grins.

                    GEOFF
          Heh-heh-heh! HEH-HEH-HEH!

He claps Adam on the shoulder.

                    GEOFF (CONT'D)
          You're learning! "Mid roll!" I like it.

Adam exhales. He's safe. They're... friends? Is that what this is?

For a moment, standing at this table with money and drinks and laughter, Adam almost forgets.

A YOUNG WOMAN (late 20s, attractive, dressed for a night out) approaches the craps table. She puts chips down.

Adam watches her. Drunk confidence talking.

                    ADAM
          (to Geoff, quietly)
          She's mid.

Geoff turns. Looks at the woman. Then at Adam.

                    GEOFF
          Mid? Really?

                    ADAM
          I mean... she's alright. Just... mid.

Geoff's smile widens.

                    GEOFF
          Heh-heh-heh. You're drunk AND judgmental now.

The woman rolls. Wins. She smiles, pleased with herself.

Geoff calls out to her.

                    GEOFF (CONT'D)
          Nice roll.

She glances over. Sees Geoff - well-dressed, confident, clearly wealthy.

                    WOMAN
          Thanks. Beginner's luck.

                    GEOFF
          You look like you know what you're doing.

She walks over, curious.

                    WOMAN
          I've played before.

                    GEOFF
          Geoff. This is Adam.

                    WOMAN
          Nicole.

                    ADAM
          Hi.

Geoff, charming and attentive.

                    GEOFF
          Winning tonight?

                    NICOLE
          Breaking even. You?

                    GEOFF
          Losing. But that's the fun, right?

They talk. Geoff buys her a drink. Adam watches, uncomfortable but too drunk to process what's happening.

After a few minutes, Geoff leans in.

                    GEOFF (CONT'D)
          You party?

Nicole raises an eyebrow.

                    NICOLE
          Depends on the party.

                    GEOFF
          I've got a suite upstairs. Some quality stuff. If you're interested.

Nicole considers. Looks at Adam.

                    NICOLE
          Both of you?

                    GEOFF
          Sure. Why not.

She shrugs. Why not indeed.

                    NICOLE
          Alright. One drink.

---

INT. CASINO HOTEL - GEOFF'S SUITE - NIGHT

Expensive. Floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the city.

Geoff, Adam, Nicole, and Moosk enter.

Nicole looks around, impressed.

                    NICOLE
          Nice place.

                    GEOFF
          Home away from home.

He gestures to the couch. Nicole sits. Adam sits across from her, swaying slightly.

Geoff goes to the bar. Pours three drinks.

                    GEOFF (CONT'D)
          So, Nicole. What do you do?

                    NICOLE
          Marketing. For a tech startup.

                    GEOFF
          Interesting. Which one?

They make small talk. Adam drinks more. The room spins slightly.

After a few minutes, Geoff pulls out a small bag of white powder. Cocaine.

                    GEOFF (CONT'D)
          You want?

Nicole hesitates, then nods.

                    NICOLE
          Sure.

Geoff pours some onto the glass coffee table. Cuts lines with a credit card.

Nicole leans down. Rolls up a bill.

Geoff watches her closely.

                    GEOFF
          (to Adam)
          You?

Adam shakes his head. Too drunk already.

Nicole snorts her line. Sits back.

                    NICOLE
          That's good stuff.

                    GEOFF
          Only the best.

He does a line himself. Then sets the card down.

Nicole leans forward for another line.

As she leans down, Geoff's hand moves.

In one fluid motion, he grabs a RAZOR BLADE from the table.

Slashes across her throat.

Nicole's eyes go wide. She tries to scream - blood sprays across the table.

Adam jolts upright.

                    ADAM
          WHAT THE FUCK--

Nicole clutches her throat. Blood pours between her fingers.

She falls sideways onto the couch. Choking. Gurgling.

Adam is frozen. Paralyzed.

Geoff calmly wipes the razor blade on Nicole's dress.

                    GEOFF
          Heh-heh-heh.

                    ADAM
          Why-- you-- she didn't--

                    GEOFF
          You said she was mid.

                    ADAM
          THAT'S NOT-- I WAS JOKING--

                    GEOFF
          Were you?

Nicole's movements slow. Stop.

The gurgling quiets.

Silence.

Adam stares at the body. At the blood soaking into the expensive couch.

                    ADAM
          I didn't... I wasn't...

                    GEOFF
          You called her mid. At my table. Using my word.

Geoff stands. Brushes off his pants.

                    GEOFF (CONT'D)
          So I figured... why not? You're learning, right? Having fun?

Adam can't breathe.

The entire night. The steak. The casino. The money. The laughter.

All of it. Building to this.

                    ADAM
          I didn't mean--

                    GEOFF
          But you did. You said it. "She's mid."

Adam's stomach churns.

                    GEOFF (CONT'D)
          Moosk. Help Adam get this cleaned up.

Moosk steps forward silently.

                    GEOFF (CONT'D)
          I'm heading out. Early meeting tomorrow.
          (to Adam)
          Oh, and Adam? Thanks for pointing her out. Good instincts.

Geoff walks to the door. Pauses.

                    GEOFF (CONT'D)
          We should do this more often. It was fun.
          (titter laugh)
          Heh-heh-heh.

He leaves.

Adam sits on the floor. Staring at Nicole's body.

Her blood drips onto the carpet.

                    ADAM
          (barely audible)
          I didn't mean it. I was drunk. I didn't...

Moosk stands over him. Red eyes glowing.

                    MOOSK
          Begin disposal preparations.

Adam pulls out his phone. Hands shaking.

Opens the transport app.

Just another job.

Just another body.

But this one?

This one is his fault.

That's all he'll ever be.

FADE OUT.
