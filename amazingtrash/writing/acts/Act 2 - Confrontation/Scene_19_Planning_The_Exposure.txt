# Scene 19 - Planning the Exposure

## LOCATION
INT. RAILYARD - SECRET CHAMBER - NIGHT

## CHARACTERS
Adam, Body (from recent disposal job)

## SCENE LAYOUT

### Opening
Adam arrives at an upscale location for a disposal job. Geoff is there with a fresh victim and Moosk. Adam has the gas
capsule hidden on him. This is his chance. While Geoff is distracted, Adam attempts to slip the pill into Geoff's drink.
But Moosk sees him.

### Key Beats
1. **The Attempt** - Adam tries to discretely release the gas capsule into Geoff's drink during the disposal pickup
2. **Caught** - Moosk sees Adam's hand over the glass with the capsule. Grabs Adam's wrist.
3. **Analysis** - Moosk squeezes the capsule and inhales the gas to analyze it, destroying it in the process. Identifies it
as a lethal neurotoxin. Geoff realizes Adam just tried to kill him.
4. **The Confrontation** - Geoff is eerily calm. Almost impressed. Asks Adam if he really thought this would work. Explains
that Moosk's surveillance makes him untouchable.
5. **The Dismissal** - Geoff tells Adam to dispose of the body and go home. No threats about revenge - just casual dismissal.
6. **The Pivot** - Alone in his lab later, Adam realizes assassination won't work. Geoff has too much protection. He
needs a different approach.
7. **The Body** - Adam has a disposal job to complete. But instead of dissolving the body, he keeps it. Evidence.
8. **Research** - Discovers Geoff has a public event coming up. That's his target - not Geoff's life, but his reputation.
9. **New Plan** - Public exposure. Media. Evidence. Make it impossible for Geoff to hide.

### Character Moments
- **Adam**: Goes from confident assassin to exposed failure to desperate strategist. Realizes he underestimated Geoff's
defenses. Adapts quickly - his survival instinct and intelligence kicking in. The casual dismissal is almost worse than
threats - Geoff doesn't even see him as a real threat.
- **Geoff**: Calm in the face of assassination attempt. Not scared, just amused. Dismisses Adam's attempt as predictable
and ineffective. Casually tells him to keep working - the assassination attempt changes nothing.
- **Moosk**: Perfect surveillance. Sees Adam's attempt instantly. Destroys the capsule by squeezing and inhaling it to
analyze. Demonstrates why Geoff is untouchable.

### Closing
Adam's gas capsule is destroyed, his first plan failed. Geoff dismissed the attempt like swatting a fly - Adam isn't even
worth killing. The humiliation stings worse than threats would have. Adam realizes assassination won't work. He needs a
different approach: public exposure. The body-keeping happens offscreen.

## FULL SCRIPT

INT. LUXURY PENTHOUSE - NIGHT

Floor-to-ceiling windows. City lights below. Expensive furniture.

A BODY lies on the marble floor. Male, fifties, well-dressed. Neck broken.

Geoff stands nearby, examining his fingernails. Bored.

Moosk stands sentinel.

The door opens. ADAM enters, carrying his equipment bag.

He stops when he sees the body.

                    GEOFF
          Adam! Right on time.

                    ADAM
          What happened?

                    GEOFF
          Business disagreement. He wanted to renegotiate our contract. Moosk disagreed more... permanently.

Adam approaches the body. In his pocket: the CAPSULE. Small, concealed.

This is it. His chance.

                    GEOFF (CONT'D)
          Drink?

Geoff walks to a bar cart. Pours himself scotch.

                    ADAM
          I'm working.

                    GEOFF
          Suit yourself.

Geoff takes a sip, sets the glass down on the bar.

Walks to the window, back to Adam.

                    GEOFF (CONT'D)
          Beautiful view. I never get tired of it.

Adam glances at the glass. Unattended.

Geoff is ten feet away, looking out at the city.

Moosk stands in the corner. Red eyes tracking, but focused on the room perimeter.

Adam's hand moves to his pocket.

Slowly. Carefully.

He palms the capsule.

Steps toward the bar.

Casual. Just getting closer to examine the body.

The capsule is in his hand now. Hidden.

He's three feet from Geoff's glass.

                    GEOFF (CONT'D)
          You know what I love about this height? Everyone looks small. Insignificant.

Adam, distracted.

                    ADAM
          Yeah.

Two feet from the glass.

His hand hovers.

Just drop it in. Geoff won't notice.

The capsule is over the glass--

Moosk's head turns toward Adam.

Red eyes lock onto his hand.

Geoff turns.

Sees Adam's hand over his drink.

Sees the capsule.

                    GEOFF
          What are you doing?

Moosk moves. Impossibly fast.

Grabs Adam's wrist.

Adam, gasping.

                    ADAM
          Let go--

Moosk pries the capsule from Adam's hand.

Holds it up. Red eyes analyze it visually.

Then squeezes it.

CRACK.

The capsule shatters in Moosk's mechanical grip.

Clear gas escapes.

Moosk INHALES deeply - drawing all the gas into his respiratory analysis chamber.

                    MOOSK
          Analyzing.

Beat.

                    MOOSK (CONT'D)
          Compound identified: Synthetic neurotoxin. Lethal dosage. Delivery method: gaseous dispersal.

Moosk releases Adam's wrist.

Adam stumbles back, cradling his hand.

The capsule is destroyed. Crushed fragments fall to the floor.

Geoff stares at Adam.

Then smiles.

                    GEOFF
          Heh. Heh-heh-heh.

He walks over. Calm. Curious.

                    GEOFF (CONT'D)
          Neurotoxin. You made this?

Adam says nothing.

                    GEOFF (CONT'D)
          Of course you did. You're quite talented, Adam. I've always said that.

He holds the capsule up to the light.

                    GEOFF (CONT'D)
          How does it work?

                    ADAM
          ...

                    GEOFF
          Come on. Professional curiosity. How long until death?

Silence.

                    GEOFF (CONT'D)
          Moosk, if he doesn't answer, hurt him.

Adam, quickly.

                    ADAM
          Eleven seconds. Once inhaled.

                    GEOFF
          Eleven seconds. Efficient.
          (pause)
          And you were going to put this in my drink.

                    ADAM
          Yes.

                    GEOFF
          So I'd breathe it when the gas released.

                    ADAM
          Yes.

                    GEOFF
          And I'd die. Right here. In my home.

                    ADAM
          Yes.

Geoff nods slowly.

                    GEOFF
          Heh-heh-heh. HEH-HEH-HEH.

He laughs harder. Genuinely amused.

                    GEOFF (CONT'D)
          Oh, Adam. You actually tried it. I'm almost impressed.

                    ADAM
          Then why are you laughing?

                    GEOFF
          Because you thought it would work! You thought Moosk wouldn't notice. You thought I'd just... drink poison and
          die.
          (laughing)
          Like some medieval king!

Adam's jaw clenches.

                    GEOFF (CONT'D)
          Do you know how much I spend on security? On surveillance? On Moosk alone?

He gestures at the destroyed capsule fragments.

                    GEOFF (CONT'D)
          Moosk watches everything. Every movement. Every gesture. He's always monitoring.

                    ADAM
          Then why did you let me get this close?

                    GEOFF
          Because I wanted to see if you'd actually try.

Beat.

                    GEOFF (CONT'D)
          And you did. How delightfully predictable.

                    ADAM
          You wanted me to--

                    GEOFF
          You tried to quit. I said no. Of course you'd try something drastic. The question was: what?
          (examines capsule again)
          A poison. Classic. Fitting for a chemist.

Adam, desperate.

                    ADAM
          Then kill me. Get it over with.

                    GEOFF
          Kill you? Why would I do that? You're useful.

                    ADAM
          I just tried to murder you.

                    GEOFF
          And you failed. Spectacularly. That's the lesson here, Adam. You can't touch me.

He looks at the destroyed capsule fragments on the floor.

                    GEOFF (CONT'D)
          Now. Dispose of that body and go home.

He nods to the corpse on the floor.

                    ADAM
          That's it?

                    GEOFF
          What else would there be? You tried, you failed, we move on. I still need disposal services.

Geoff walks to the door. Moosk follows.

                    GEOFF (CONT'D)
          Same arrangement as before. I'll call when I need you.

He pauses at the door.

                    GEOFF (CONT'D)
          Oh, and Adam? Don't try that again. Next time might be less amusing.

The door closes.

Adam stands alone with the corpse.

His plan failed.

Geoff dismissed him like an insect.

He looks at the body. Another victim of Geoff's casual cruelty.

Adam pulls out his equipment bag.

But instead of dissolving this one...

Maybe there's another way.

FADE OUT.
