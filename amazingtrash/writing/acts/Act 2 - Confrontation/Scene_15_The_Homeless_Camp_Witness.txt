# Scene 15 - The Homeless Camp Witness

## LOCATION
EXT. TRACKTOWN TUNNELS / INT. TRACKTOWN CRAWLSPACES - NIGHT

## CHARACTERS
Adam, Joe (Tracktown resident), Body

## SCENE LAYOUT

### Opening
The Amazing Company auto-car drops Adam off at the edge of Tracktown (the railyard homeless encampment). He can't drive
directly to his secret disposal chamber - that would be too obvious, create a trail. He opens the cargo area to find the
body wrapped in plastic. He'll have to drag it through the shadows and crawlspaces to his hidden lab.

### Key Beats
1. **Finding cover** - Adam searches for something to conceal the body during transport. Finds an old barrel - perfect,
like the ones he uses for chemical storage.
2. **The drag** - Stuffs body into barrel, begins dragging it through Tracktown's edges, staying in shadows and
crawlspaces.
3. **Joe appears** - JOE, the neighborhood busybody/representative Adam knows from Scene 9, spots him in the dim light
dragging something heavy.
4. **The lie** - Adam has to quickly explain it's "just scavenged supplies" he's moving to his spot.
5. **Joe helps** - Joe, being friendly and helpful, offers to assist. Adam can't refuse without raising suspicion.
6. **Close call** - Joe talks the entire time, making conversation, but is too distracted by his own chatting to really
look closely at what they're moving. Adam sweats through every second.

### Character Moments
- **Adam**: Terrified of being discovered by someone from his own community. The people he's come to care about can't
know what he does. Has to maintain the lie while Joe unknowingly helps him move a corpse. The guilt is compounded - not
just disposing bodies, but lying to his friends.
- **Joe**: Friendly, talkative, helpful. Represents the community Adam has found. Completely oblivious to what's actually
happening, which makes it worse - his trust makes Adam's betrayal more painful.

### Closing
They get the barrel to Adam's area. Joe leaves, cheerful, telling Adam to let him know if he needs help with anything
else. Adam is left alone with the barrel containing a body, surrounded by the community he's deceiving. The two halves of
his life - his friends and his horrible work - have nearly collided.

## FULL SCRIPT

EXT. TRACKTOWN - EDGE - NIGHT

The Amazing Company auto-car sits at the perimeter of the railyard encampment. Distant structures, makeshift shelters,
low fires.

The cargo door opens.

Adam pulls out a large PLASTIC-WRAPPED BUNDLE. The body. He glances around nervously.

Can't carry it through the open. Too obvious.

He scans the area. Debris, scrap metal, abandoned equipment.

There - an old BARREL. Dented, rusty, but intact.

Adam drags it over, checks inside. Empty.

He struggles to stuff the plastic-wrapped body into the barrel. Arms fold wrong. Head won't fit.

Adam, quietly.

                    ADAM
          Come on... just...

He pushes harder. Something CRUNCHES. Ribs, probably.

The body finally fits. Barely.

Adam seals the top, then grabs the barrel's rim and starts dragging it.

SCRAPE. SCRAPE. SCRAPE.

Too loud.

He stops, lifts slightly, continues. Better.

He moves into the shadows between structures, heading for his hidden entrance.

INT. TRACKTOWN - CRAWLSPACE - NIGHT

Tight passage between two lean-to shelters. Adam drags the barrel through.

His breathing echoes. Sweat drips.

Almost there. Just need to--

VOICE (O.S.)
Adam? That you?

Adam freezes.

Joe emerges from the shadows - 50s, weathered face, friendly smile. The neighborhood busybody.

Adam, forced casual.

                    ADAM
          Hey, Joe.

                    JOE
          Whatcha got there?

Joe approaches, curious.

                    ADAM
          Just... supplies. Scavenged some stuff.

                    JOE
          At this hour?

                    ADAM
          Found a good spot. Didn't want someone else to grab it first.

Joe peers at the barrel.

                    JOE
          Heavy?

                    ADAM
          Not too bad.

                    JOE
          Looks heavy. You're sweating.

                    ADAM
          It's... yeah. Little heavy.

                    JOE
          Where you taking it?

                    ADAM
          My spot. Storage.

Joe, grabbing the other side.

                    JOE
          Here, I'll help.

                    ADAM
          No, that's--

                    JOE
          Nonsense. Community helps community, right?

Joe lifts his side of the barrel.

Adam has no choice. He lifts his side.

They carry it together.

Adam, panicking internally.

                    ADAM
          Really, Joe, I can--

                    JOE
          What'd you find? Anything good?

                    ADAM
          Just... parts. Metal. Might be able to sell it.

                    JOE
          Smart. You've been real resourceful lately. Everyone's noticed.

They navigate through the crawlspace. The barrel shifts.

Something heavy slides inside.

THUD.

Joe doesn't react.

                    JOE (CONT'D)
          You coming to the potluck tomorrow?

                    ADAM
          Potluck?

                    JOE
          Maria's organizing. Bring something if you can. If not, just come. It's about community.

Adam, distracted.

                    ADAM
          Yeah. Maybe.

They round a corner. Tighter space.

                    JOE
          How are your friends? That kid Tyson and the girl - Gal?

                    ADAM
          They're good.

                    JOE
          Good people. Nice to see you connecting. You were so closed off when you first got here.

Adam, hollow.

                    ADAM
          Yeah.

They reach a section near Adam's hidden entrance. A covered opening, easy to miss.

                    ADAM (CONT'D)
          Here's good. I can take it from here.

                    JOE
          You sure? Happy to--

Adam, too quick.

                    ADAM
          I'm sure. Thanks, Joe. Really.

They set the barrel down.

Joe straightens, wipes his hands.

                    JOE
          No problem. That's what we do.
          (pats Adam's shoulder)
          You're part of this place now, Adam. Don't forget that.

Adam, guilt crushing him.

                    ADAM
          I won't.

                    JOE
          See you at the potluck?

                    ADAM
          ...Yeah.

Joe walks away, whistling tunelessly.

Adam watches him go.

When Joe disappears, Adam exhales - a shaking, terrified breath.

He looks at the barrel.

Joe helped him carry a corpse.

Joe, who welcomed him. Who said "you're part of this place."

Adam just made Joe an unwitting accomplice.

Adam, quietly.

                    ADAM
          What am I doing...

He drags the barrel to the hidden entrance. Pulls back the covering.

A dark passage leading down.

He maneuvers the barrel through, follows it into the darkness.

The covering slides back into place.

From above, nothing. Just another section of the railyard.

Below, Adam descends with his terrible cargo.

Surrounded by the community that trusts him.

Doing the work that would destroy that trust forever.

FADE OUT.

## Production Notes
- Nighttime railyard setting, minimal lighting
- Amazing Company auto-car at perimeter
- Body wrapped in plastic sheeting
- Old barrel for concealment
- Crawlspaces and shadows between encampment structures
- Joe should feel warm, friendly - contrast to Adam's terror
- Barrel is heavy, awkward to move
- Adam's visible stress vs. Joe's oblivious cheerfulness
