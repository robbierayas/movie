# Scene 20 - Retribution

## LOCATION
EXT. RAILYARD - TRACKTOWN ENCAMPMENT - DAWN

## CHARACTERS
Adam, Moosk, Geoff (hologram), Gal (body), Tyson

## SCENE LAYOUT

### Opening
Dawn breaks over Tracktown. Adam has been awake all night planning the exposure. He returns to Tracktown to check on
Tyson and Gal - to make sure they're safe after the "Consequences" text from Moosk. As he approaches, he sees an Amazing
Company auto-car pulling away from the encampment. His blood runs cold.

### Key Beats
1. **The Auto-Car** - Adam sees the car leaving. Recognizes it. Starts running toward Tracktown.
2. **Moosk's Message** - The car stops. Window rolls down. Moosk sits inside with a hologram projector. Geoff's hologram
appears: calm, almost sympathetic. "We all do bad things, Adam. But I can forgive... if you can forgive."
3. **The Implication** - Geoff's message is clear: something has been done. Punishment has been delivered. The question
is whether Adam will accept it and move forward, or escalate further.
4. **The Car Leaves** - Moosk drives away without a word. The hologram fades. Adam is left standing in the road.
5. **The Search** - Adam runs into Tracktown, frantically looking for Tyson and Gal. Finds Tyson first - alive, sleeping.
Relief floods through him.
6. **The Discovery** - Then he finds Gal's body at the entrance to his spot - not inside the chamber (where the preserved
body is hidden), but at the entrance where only he would find her. Neck broken. Clean. Professional. The same way Moosk kills.
7. **The Realization** - She died because Adam tried to kill Geoff. This is his fault. She wanted to escape Tracktown and
now she'll never leave.
8. **Tyson's Horror** - Tyson wakes up, finds Adam with Gal's body. The two friends realize what's happened. Geoff kept
his word - consequences.
9. **The Disposal Argument** - Adam suggests disposing of Gal's body to avoid questions. Tyson is horrified and refuses -
"She's our FRIEND!" He insists she deserves people to know she existed and mattered.
10. **The Funeral Decision** - Tyson decides to ask Marie to arrange a proper funeral. Adam wants to argue about the danger
but realizes Tyson is right - Gal deserves better than acid and silence. Tyson leaves to find Marie.

### Character Moments
- **Adam**: Overwhelming guilt. The last conversation he had with Gal was a fight. He snapped at her, pushed her away,
and now she's dead because of his choices. Rage at Geoff mixed with self-hatred. This is the breaking point.
- **Geoff (hologram)**: Cold "forgiveness." Treats murder like a business negotiation. The message is power disguised as
mercy - I could have killed you all, but I'm being reasonable. One death as a lesson.
- **Moosk**: Silent executioner. Delivers the message and leaves. No emotion, no explanation. Just enforcement.
- **Tyson**: Wakes to find his friend dead. Traumatized. Young enough that this level of violence is still shocking.
Refuses to let Adam dispose of Gal's body - she deserves better. Takes charge, insists on a proper funeral. Shows maturity
and moral conviction even in grief.
- **Gal**: Dead before the scene starts. Never got to escape. Never got her dreams. Last words to Adam were about not
getting comfortable. Now she never will. But Tyson ensures she won't be forgotten - she'll have a funeral, a community
remembering her.

### Closing
Adam suggests disposing of Gal to avoid questions, but Tyson refuses - she deserves people to know she existed, that she
mattered. Tyson goes to find Marie to arrange a proper funeral. Adam stays with Gal's body as the sun rises. Act 2 ends in
tragedy, but also with a glimmer of dignity - Gal will be remembered and honored, not erased.

## FULL SCRIPT

EXT. CITY STREET - DAWN

Grey light. Empty streets.

Adam walks quickly, phone in hand. He's been up all night.

He checks the time: 6:03 AM.

Turns the corner toward Tracktown.

And stops.

An AMAZING COMPANY AUTO-CAR sits at the encampment's entrance.

Pristine. Black. Wrong.

Adam's heart drops.

The car's engine is running.

Adam, quietly.

                    ADAM
          No...

He starts running.

---

EXT. RAILYARD - TRACKTOWN ENTRANCE - DAWN

Adam sprints toward the car.

It starts moving. Pulling away.

                    ADAM
          WAIT!

The car stops.

The rear window lowers.

Moosk sits in the back seat. Red eyes glowing in the dim light.

In front of him: a HOLOGRAM PROJECTOR.

It activates.

GEOFF's image appears. Life-sized. Sitting calmly as if in the car.

Geoff (HOLOGRAM)
Good morning, Adam.

Adam, gasping for breath.

                    ADAM
          What did you do?

Geoff (HOLOGRAM)
We needed to have a conversation. About consequences. About understanding.

                    ADAM
          Where are they?

Geoff (HOLOGRAM)
We all make mistakes, Adam. You. Me. Even poor choices we regret.

Adam, desperate.

                    ADAM
          What did you DO?

Geoff (HOLOGRAM)
I did what was necessary. What you forced me to do.

Adam's fists clench.

Geoff (HOLOGRAM) (CONT'D)
But I'm not unreasonable. I believe in proportional response. An eye for an eye. You tried to take my life...
(pause)
So I took one of yours.

Adam's vision blurs.

Geoff (HOLOGRAM) (CONT'D)
The question now is: can we move past this? Can we forgive each other's... transgressions?

Adam shakes their head.

                    ADAM
          You killed--

Geoff (HOLOGRAM)
I made a point. Now. Will you accept it and move forward? Or do we need further... education?

Adam lunges toward the car.

The window rises. The car accelerates.

                    ADAM
          COME BACK!

But it's gone. Disappearing into the morning streets.

Adam stands alone in the road.

Breathing hard.

One of yours.

He runs into Tracktown.

---

EXT. RAILYARD - TRACKTOWN - DAWN

Adam tears through the encampment.

Shelters. Sleeping people. Morning fires starting.

No sign of Tyson or Gal.

                    ADAM
          TYSON! GAL!

A few residents stir. Look at him confused.

Adam runs to the area where Tyson usually sleeps.

Empty.

Adam (cont'd), panicking.

                    ADAM (CONT'D)
          No no no--

He searches frantically.

Behind a shelter - movement.

Tyson lies curled up under a blanket. Sleeping.

Adam drops to his knees beside him.

Grabs his shoulder.

                    ADAM (CONT'D)
          Tyson. Tyson wake up.

Tyson's eyes open. Confused.

                    TYSON
          Adam? What--

Adam pulls him into a hug. Too tight. Desperate.

Tyson (cont'd), muffled.

                    TYSON (CONT'D)
          Can't breathe--

Adam releases him. Checks him over. No injuries.

                    ADAM
          You're okay. You're okay.

                    TYSON
          Why wouldn't I be?

Adam doesn't answer.

If Tyson is alive...

He stands. Looks around.

                    TYSON (CONT'D)
          What's going on?

                    ADAM
          Where's Gal?

                    TYSON
          I don't know. Haven't seen her since last night. Why?

Adam's stomach sinks.

Last night. The dinner. The fight.

He starts searching again. Tyson follows, worried.

                    TYSON (CONT'D)
          Adam, you're scaring me. What happened?

Adam doesn't respond. Checking shelters. Behind structures.

Then he stops.

His hidden spot. The entrance to his secret chamber.

The covering is disturbed.

Someone was here.

Someone who knew where to look.

Adam, barely audible.

                    ADAM
          No...

He pulls the covering aside.

And stops.

Gal lies there. At the entrance to his hidden spot. Arms at her sides. Eyes closed.

Peaceful. Almost sleeping.

But her head is turned too far. Neck broken.

Clean. Professional.

Someone placed her here. Where only Adam would find her.

A message.

---

EXT. RAILYARD - ADAM'S SPOT - DAWN

Adam's knees buckle.

Adam, quietly.

                    ADAM
          Gal...

Tyson comes up behind him.

                    TYSON
          Adam? What's--

He sees Gal's body at the entrance to Adam's spot.

Stops.

                    TYSON (CONT'D)
          ...Gal?

He takes a step forward.

                    TYSON (CONT'D)
          Gal, come on. This isn't funny.

Adam doesn't move. Can't speak.

Tyson kneels beside her. Shakes her shoulder.

                    TYSON (CONT'D)
          Gal. Wake up.

No response.

Tyson's hand goes to her neck. Checking for a pulse.

His fingers find the wrong angle. The break.

He pulls his hand back like it's burned.

                    TYSON (CONT'D)
          No. No no no--

Adam, hoarse.

                    ADAM
          She's gone.

                    TYSON
          No! She was fine last night! She was--

His voice cracks.

Tyson (cont'd) turns to Gal.

                    TYSON (CONT'D)
          You were fine. We just had dinner. You-- you taught me how to hold a fork. You...

Tears stream down his face.

                    ADAM
          I'm sorry.

                    TYSON
          What happened? Was it an accident? Did she fall?

                    ADAM
          No.

                    TYSON
          Then what?

Adam can't say it. Can't admit it.

                    TYSON (CONT'D)
          WHAT HAPPENED?

Adam, breaking.

                    ADAM
          It was Geoff. He... he killed her. Because I tried to kill him.

Tyson stares.

                    TYSON
          You what?

                    ADAM
          I tried to poison him. Last night. His robot caught me. And he... he said there would be consequences. I
          thought he meant me. I didn't think...

He looks at Gal.

                    ADAM (CONT'D)
          I didn't think he'd go after you. After her.

Tyson, realization dawning.

                    TYSON
          Your "work." The money. That's what you do? You work for him?

                    ADAM
          I didn't have a choice.

                    TYSON
          You always have a choice!

                    ADAM
          Not with him. You don't understand--

                    TYSON
          You're right. I don't understand. I don't understand how you could work for someone who KILLS PEOPLE.

Adam has no defense.

                    TYSON (CONT'D)
          She wanted out. Out of Tracktown. She had plans. She was going to--

His voice breaks again.

Tyson collapses beside Gal. Touching her arm.

Tyson (cont'd) turns to Gal.

                    TYSON (CONT'D)
          I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

                    ADAM
          Tyson--

                    TYSON
          Don't. Just... don't.

Silence.

Just their breathing. Tyson's crying.

And Gal. Still. Silent.

Adam kneels on her other side.

Looks at her face.

The last thing he said to her was "Nothing important." Snapped at her for caring.

The last conversation was a fight.

She left angry. Hurt.

And he never apologized.

Never said--

Adam, quietly.

                    ADAM
          I'm sorry, Gal. I'm so sorry.

He takes her hand. Still warm.

Recent. This happened maybe an hour ago.

While Adam was planning his exposure. While Tyson was sleeping.

Moosk came. Broke her neck. Left her at the entrance to Adam's spot.

Where only Adam would find her.

A message.

Sunlight begins breaking over Tracktown. Dawn fully arrived.

A new day.

Without Gal.

Without hope.

Tyson looks up at Adam.

                    TYSON
          What do we do now?

Adam stares at Gal's body.

He knows what he does with bodies.

He has the equipment. The chemicals.

No evidence. No questions.

But this is Gal.

Adam, quietly.

                    ADAM
          I can... I can take care of it. Make sure no one finds her. Make sure there's no--

                    TYSON
          What?

                    ADAM
          I have a way. To... to dispose of--

Tyson, standing abruptly.

                    TYSON
          DISPOSE?

                    ADAM
          I didn't mean--

                    TYSON
          You want to dissolve her? Like she's... like she's trash?

                    ADAM
          No! I just meant--

                    TYSON
          She's our FRIEND, Adam! She's not one of Geoff's victims! She's GAL!

Adam, defensive.

                    ADAM
          I know that! But if the police find her, they'll ask questions. They'll investigate. They might find--

                    TYSON
          I don't care!

Silence.

Tyson, quieter but firm.

                    TYSON (CONT'D)
          She deserves better than that. She deserves... she deserves people to know she existed. That she mattered.

Adam looks at Gal's body. Then at Tyson.

                    TYSON (CONT'D)
          We're giving her a funeral. A real one.

                    ADAM
          Tyson--

                    TYSON
          I'm going to ask Marie to arrange it. Gal would've wanted that. She'd want people to remember her.

Adam wants to argue. Wants to explain the danger.

But Tyson is right.

Gal deserves better than acid and silence.

Adam, hollow.

                    ADAM
          Okay.

Tyson nods. Wipes his eyes.

                    TYSON
          I'll go find Marie now.

He takes one last look at Gal.

Then walks away into the awakening Tracktown.

Adam stays kneeling beside Gal's body.

The sun rises over the railyard.

A new day.

Without Gal.

But she won't be forgotten.

FADE OUT.

**END OF ACT 2**
