# Scene 18 - Mid Night Out

## LOCATION
INT. MID CLASS RESTAURANT / EXT. CITY STREETS - NIGHT

## CHARACTERS
Adam, Tyson (T), Gal, Body (kept for plan)

## SCENE LAYOUT

### Opening
Adam takes Tyson and Gal out for a "Mid night" - deliberately using Geoff's slang ironically. It's a good night out with
his earnings, mid-tier restaurant and experiences. For once, he's giving back to the people who matter. The three friends
share a meal, laugh together. It feels normal. Almost perfect.

### Key Beats
1. **Dinner** - Mid-class restaurant. Gal teaches Tyson table manners playfully. They laugh, share food, enjoy
themselves. This is what Adam's money should be for - his friends, not more disposal jobs.
2. **The Conversation** - After dinner, Adam wants to keep the night going but Tyson and Gal are tired. Gal takes it the
wrong way - thinks Adam's showing off or trying to buy their friendship.
3. **Dessert Break** - They send Tyson to grab dessert from a nearby shop, giving Adam and Gal privacy.
4. **Dreams and Fears** - Gal reveals she doesn't want to get used to the good life. She's hoping to escape Tracktown
someday. Doesn't want to get comfortable because it might trap her there.
5. **The Fight** - The conversation turns sour. Maybe Adam's defensive, maybe Gal's frustrated. They misunderstand each
other. Gal leaves separately.
6. **Second Fight** - Tyson returns with dessert. Adam and Tyson head home together, but Adam says something wrong -
still angry from the talk with Gal. Tyson runs off on his own.
7. **The Drone** - Alone and quiet, Adam hears a DRONE overhead. He looks up - it shoots off into the darkness. Geoff is
watching. Has been the whole time.
8. **The Body** - Adam has a disposal job this night (perhaps before or after the dinner). He keeps the body instead of
disposing it - needs it for his exposure plan later.

### Character Moments
- **Adam**: Trying to be generous and normal with his friends, but his guilt and secrets poison even this. When things go
wrong, his defensiveness and anger push both friends away. Realizes too late that Geoff is surveillance him - even his
friendships aren't safe.
- **Tyson**: Young, enjoying the experience. Learns manners from Gal. Hurt when Adam snaps at him, runs off impulsively.
- **Gal**: Wants to dream bigger than Tracktown but is afraid of false hope. Misreads Adam's generosity as showing off or
manipulation. Protective of her boundaries.

### Closing
Adam stands alone on a dark street, calling for Tyson. The drone is gone. His friends are gone. He's isolated himself
through his secrets and his anger. The last good moment with his friends has crumbled. One of them will die soon because
of his choices.

## FULL SCRIPT

INT. MID CLASS RESTAURANT - NIGHT

A mid-tier establishment. Clean but not fancy. Families eating. Working people on dates. Real people.

Adam, TYSON, and GAL sit at a booth. Menus open.

                    TYSON
          We can really get anything?

                    ADAM
          Anything on the menu.

Tyson, whispered to Gal.

                    TYSON
          How much is anything?

                    GAL
          Don't worry about it. Adam's treating.

A WAITER approaches.

                    WAITER
          Ready to order?

                    TYSON
          I want the... uh...
          (struggling with pronunciation)
          Fillet mig-non?

Gal, gently.

                    GAL
          Filet mignon. Silent T.

                    TYSON
          Right. That.

                    WAITER
          Excellent choice. And for you, miss?

                    GAL
          The salmon, please. With the roasted vegetables.

                    ADAM
          Same. Make it two.

The waiter collects menus and leaves.

Tyson watches him go, then immediately grabs his water glass with both hands and drinks.

Gal reaches over, gently moves one of his hands off the glass.

                    GAL
          One hand. Hold it like this.

She demonstrates. Tyson mimics her.

                    TYSON
          Why?

                    GAL
          Manners. Trust me, it matters.

                    ADAM
          Does it?

                    GAL
          If you want to blend in with Standard or Mid class? Yeah. Little things give you away.

She adjusts Tyson's napkin placement.

                    GAL (CONT'D)
          Napkin in lap. Not tucked into your shirt.

                    TYSON
          That's stupid. Tucked catches more food.

Adam laughs.

                    ADAM
          He's not wrong.

                    GAL
          That's not the point.

She looks at Adam, mock-serious.

                    GAL (CONT'D)
          You too. Napkin.

Adam obeys, placing his napkin in his lap with exaggerated care.

They all laugh.

For a moment, it's just three friends having dinner.

Nothing weighing on them.

Nothing dark lurking.

INT. MID CLASS RESTAURANT - LATER

Plates empty. Tyson leans back, satisfied.

                    TYSON
          That was incredible.

                    GAL
          Best meal I've had in... maybe ever.

                    ADAM
          Yeah?

                    GAL
          Yeah. Thank you, Adam.

                    ADAM
          It's nothing.

                    GAL
          It's not nothing.

An awkward beat.

                    ADAM
          You know what? There's this place downtown. Dessert place. We could--

Gal, checking the time.

                    GAL
          It's late.

                    ADAM
          So? The night's still young.

Tyson, yawning.

                    TYSON
          I'm pretty tired.

                    ADAM
          Come on. One more stop.

                    GAL
          Adam...

                    ADAM
          What?

                    GAL
          We're good. This was great. Let's not push it.

Something in her tone. Adam bristles.

                    ADAM
          Push it?

                    GAL
          You know what I mean.

                    ADAM
          No, I don't. Explain.

Tyson looks between them, sensing tension.

                    GAL
          Nothing. Forget it.

                    ADAM
          We're having a good time. Why stop now?

                    GAL
          Because I don't want to get used to this.

                    ADAM
          Used to what? Having a nice meal?

                    GAL
          Yes! Exactly.

                    ADAM
          That doesn't make sense.

Gal, frustrated.

                    GAL
          I'm trying to get OUT of Tracktown, Adam. I can't... I can't get comfortable. I can't start thinking this is
          normal.

                    ADAM
          So enjoying a dinner is a problem?

                    GAL
          It is if I start expecting it. If I get used to good things, it'll hurt more when they stop.

                    ADAM
          They don't have to stop.

                    GAL
          Yes, they do. They always do.

Silence.

Adam, defensive.

                    ADAM
          I'm just trying to do something nice.

                    GAL
          I know. And I appreciate it. But I need to keep my head clear. Remember what I'm working toward.

                    ADAM
          Which is what?

                    GAL
          Not this. Not Tracktown. Something better.

                    ADAM
          This IS better. Tonight. Us. Isn't that enough?

                    GAL
          For now. But not forever.

The words hang there.

Adam, coldly.

                    ADAM
          Fine.

                    GAL
          Adam--

                    ADAM
          No, you're right. Don't get comfortable.

                    GAL
          You're twisting what I said.

                    ADAM
          Am I?

Gal stands.

Gal turns to Tyson.

                    GAL
          Can you grab us dessert from that shop across the street? Three of anything. Your choice.

                    TYSON
          Uh... sure.

Gal hands him some money. Tyson glances at Adam, then leaves.

Gal sits back down.

                    GAL
          What's going on with you?

                    ADAM
          Nothing.

                    GAL
          You've been weird all night. Tense.

                    ADAM
          I'm fine.

                    GAL
          You're not.

Adam, snapping.

                    ADAM
          I'm trying to have one normal night, Gal. Is that allowed?

                    GAL
          Of course it is. But this doesn't feel normal. It feels... I don't know. Desperate.

The word hits Adam hard.

                    ADAM
          Desperate.

                    GAL
          Like you're trying too hard. Buying friendship or--

                    ADAM
          That's not what this is.

                    GAL
          Then what is it?

Adam can't answer. Can't tell her the truth.

Can't say: I might die trying to kill Geoff. Or you might die if I don't.

                    GAL (CONT'D)
          I care about you, Adam. But I need to protect myself. I can't let this--
          (gestures around)
          --become my normal. Because when it goes away, it'll destroy me.

                    ADAM
          So you're protecting yourself by pushing me away?

                    GAL
          I'm protecting myself by being realistic.

                    ADAM
          Right. Realistic.

Gal, standing.

                    GAL
          I'm gonna go. Tell T I said thanks for the company.

She leaves.

Adam sits alone at the table.

The waiter approaches with the check.

---

EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT

Adam walks, hands in pockets.

Tyson catches up, carrying a bag of desserts.

                    TYSON
          Where's Gal?

                    ADAM
          Went home.

                    TYSON
          What happened?

                    ADAM
          Nothing. Just... she wanted to go.

                    TYSON
          Did you guys fight?

                    ADAM
          No.

They walk in silence.

                    TYSON
          The desserts are really good. Want one?

                    ADAM
          Not hungry.

                    TYSON
          Adam?

                    ADAM
          What?

                    TYSON
          Thanks for dinner. It meant a lot.

Adam doesn't respond.

More silence.

                    TYSON (CONT'D)
          Gal's just scared, you know. Of getting hurt.

                    ADAM
          I wasn't trying to hurt her.

                    TYSON
          I know. But good things scare her. She's used to bad things. At least those are predictable.

                    ADAM
          That's stupid.

                    TYSON
          Maybe. But it's how she survives.

Adam, irritated.

                    ADAM
          Why are you defending her?

                    TYSON
          I'm not. I'm just saying--

                    ADAM
          I did something nice and she threw it back in my face. End of story.

                    TYSON
          That's not--

Adam, louder.

                    ADAM
          I'm TRYING to be a good friend, Tyson. I'm trying to do right by you guys. But apparently that's "desperate" or
          whatever--

                    TYSON
          Whoa, I didn't say that--

                    ADAM
          I know you didn't! Gal did!

                    TYSON
          Okay. Okay.

Beat.

                    TYSON (CONT'D)
          You're really mad.

                    ADAM
          I'm not mad.

                    TYSON
          You're yelling.

                    ADAM
          I'm not--

Adam catches himself. Takes a breath.

                    ADAM (CONT'D)
          Sorry.

                    TYSON
          It's okay.

                    ADAM
          No, it's not. You didn't do anything.

                    TYSON
          Bad night?

                    ADAM
          Yeah. Bad night.

                    TYSON
          Tomorrow will be better.

Adam looks at Tyson. Young. Optimistic. Hopeful.

Completely unaware that Geoff has him in a surveillance database.

Adam, softly.

                    ADAM
          I hope so.

                    TYSON
          Want to walk back together?

                    ADAM
          Actually... I need to take care of something. Work stuff.

                    TYSON
          Now?

                    ADAM
          Yeah.

                    TYSON
          Weird hours.

                    ADAM
          That's the job.

                    TYSON
          What do you even do?

Adam, too sharp.

                    ADAM
          Nothing you'd understand.

Tyson steps back, hurt.

                    TYSON
          Okay. Jeez.

                    ADAM
          Tyson--

                    TYSON
          No, it's fine. You're busy. I get it.

                    ADAM
          I didn't mean--

                    TYSON
          I'll see you later, Adam.

Tyson walks away quickly.

                    ADAM
          Tyson, wait--

But Tyson is already gone, disappearing around a corner.

Adam stands alone on the empty street.

Both his friends driven away in one night.

The silence settles.

Then: a sound. Faint. Mechanical.

WHIRRRRRR.

Adam looks up.

A DRONE hovers above, thirty feet up. Small. A single red light blinking.

Watching him.

Adam, quietly.

                    ADAM
          No...

The drone's light blinks once. Twice.

Then it shoots off into the darkness, disappearing.

Geoff knows about the dinner.

About Tyson and Gal.

He's been watching.

Adam (cont'd), calling out.

                    ADAM (CONT'D)
          TYSON!

His voice echoes.

No response.

Adam runs to the corner where Tyson disappeared.

Empty street.

                    ADAM (CONT'D)
          TYSON!

Nothing.

Just darkness.

And somewhere above, a drone recording everything.

Adam stands in the empty street, breathing hard.

The last good moment with his friends is gone.

And one of them will pay the price.

FADE OUT.

## Production Notes
- Mid-class restaurant: nicer than tracktown, not as fancy as Geoff's establishments
- Visible contrast with Geoff's luxury restaurant from Scene 13
- Tyson learning manners - comedic but sweet
- Shift from happy/laughing to tense/uncomfortable
- Drone: small, quiet, red light visible
- Body transport happens before or after dinner (brief scene)
- Adam's emotional journey: hopeful → defensive → angry → alone
- Dark empty street for final moment
