# Scene 16 - I'm Out

## LOCATION
INT. GEOFF'S OFFICE - DAY

## CHARACTERS
Adam, Geoff, Moosk

## SCENE LAYOUT

### Opening
Adam arrives at Geoff's office during the day. Sleek, modern, expensive - the opposite of Tracktown. He's been summoned for what he thinks is another disposal job, but he's decided: this is where he tells Geoff he's done. Geoff sits at his desk, Moosk standing nearby. The contrast is stark - Adam in his worn clothes in this pristine billionaire's office.

### Key Beats
1. **The Declaration** - Adam tells Geoff he's done. Can't do this anymore. The risk is too great - not just for him, but
for his friends, his community.
2. **Geoff's Refusal** - Geoff calmly explains that Adam doesn't get to quit. He knows too much. He's seen too much.
3. **The Threat** - Geoff makes it explicit: if Adam tries to quit or talk to anyone (police, media, friends), Moosk will
make sure everyone Adam cares about suffers. Not just Adam - Tyson, Gal, Joe, everyone at Tracktown.
4. **Adam's Realization** - Adam understands he's completely trapped. There's no walking away. The only exit is death -
his or Geoff's.
5. **Geoff Leaves** - Geoff departs, confident Adam will comply. Moosk lingers a moment, a silent reminder of the threat,
then follows.

### Character Moments
- **Adam**: Tries to assert himself, to reclaim agency. But realizes he has none. His attempt to protect his friends by
quitting actually puts them in more danger - now they're explicit hostages. His desperation turns to cold determination -
if he can't quit, he'll have to find another way out.
- **Geoff**: Reveals the full extent of control. Not angry, just matter-of-fact. This is how power works. Adam is
trapped, and Geoff wants him to understand that completely. No false hope.
- **Moosk**: Physical embodiment of the threat. His presence makes Geoff's words concrete and terrifying.

### Closing
Adam leaves Geoff's office, defeated. He's trapped - can't quit, can't run, can't tell anyone. Geoff has weaponized his community against him. Everyone at Tracktown is now a hostage. The only option left: eliminate Geoff himself. This scene plants the seed for his assassination attempt.

## FULL SCRIPT

INT. GEOFF'S OFFICE - DAY

Sleek. Modern. Floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the city. Everything pristine and expensive.

GEOFF sits at his desk, scrolling through his tablet. Bored.

MOOSK stands in the corner. Red eyes scanning.

The door opens. ADAM enters, looking out of place in his worn clothes.

Geoff glances up.

                    GEOFF
          Adam. You're early.

                    ADAM
          We need to talk.

                    GEOFF
          About the next job? It's simple. Same as usual--

                    ADAM
          I can't do this anymore.

Geoff sets down the tablet. Looks at Adam properly now.

                    GEOFF
          Can't?

                    ADAM
          I'm done. I'm out.

Silence.

Geoff leans back in his chair. Studies Adam. Then smiles.

                    GEOFF
          No.

                    ADAM
          I'm not asking. I'm telling you. I'm done.

                    GEOFF
          And I'm telling you: no.

                    ADAM
          I've done everything you asked. For months. But I can't anymore.

                    GEOFF
          Can't? Or won't?

                    ADAM
          Does it matter?

Geoff, pleasant.

                    GEOFF
          It doesn't. Because the answer is the same. No.

Adam, desperate.

                    ADAM
          Geoff, the risk is too high. That thing at the warehouse, the police--

                    GEOFF
          We handled it.

                    ADAM
          Joe helped me carry a body! MY FRIEND--

                    GEOFF
          Keep your voice down.

Adam catches himself. The watchers are closer now, curious about the confrontation.

Adam shakes their head.

                    ADAM
          This can't continue. Eventually someone will figure it out. I'll get caught, or worse--

                    GEOFF
          You'll be careful.

                    ADAM
          I'm trying to be careful! That's why I'm quitting!

Geoff, harder.

                    GEOFF
          You're not quitting.

                    ADAM
          Yes, I am.

                    GEOFF
          Adam. Think about what you're saying.

                    ADAM
          I have thought about it. I'm done.

Geoff's smile fades.

                    GEOFF
          You know too much.

                    ADAM
          I won't say anything. I'll just... disappear. You'll never hear from me--

                    GEOFF
          You've seen me kill people. Multiple people. You know my face, my name, my methods. You think I'm just going to
          let you walk away with that?

                    ADAM
          I said I won't--

Geoff, cutting him off.

                    GEOFF
          Your word means nothing. You're a liability.

                    ADAM
          Then what do you want from me?

                    GEOFF
          The same thing I've always wanted. You do your job. I do mine. It's simple.

                    ADAM
          And if I refuse?

Geoff glances around the railyard. At the people. The shelters. The community.

                    GEOFF
          Then I'll have to insulate myself from the liability.

                    ADAM
          Meaning?

                    GEOFF
          You know what I mean.

Adam, cold.

                    ADAM
          Say it.

                    GEOFF
          Moosk?

Moosk's head turns toward Adam. Red eyes glowing.

                    GEOFF (CONT'D)
          How many people live in... what do you call it? Tracktown?

                    MOOSK
          Sixty-three residents identified. An additional twenty-one individuals frequent the area.
          Total: eighty-four individuals.

The casual precision is chilling.

                    GEOFF
          And you have data on all of them?

                    MOOSK
          Affirmative. Facial recognition complete. Social connections mapped. Real-time location tracking available.

Geoff looks at Adam.

                    GEOFF
          See? It's not just about you anymore.

Adam, horror dawning.

                    ADAM
          You wouldn't...

                    GEOFF
          Let me be clear. If you try to quit, I'll handle the liability. If you go to the police, I'll handle the
          liability. If you tell anyone what you do for me... I'll handle the liability.

                    ADAM
          These are innocent people.

                    GEOFF
          These are your friends. Your community. The people you care about.
          (leans in)
          Which means they're leverage.

                    ADAM
          You can't--

                    GEOFF
          I absolutely can. You've seen what I can do. You've cleaned it up. Don't pretend you don't know exactly what
          I'm capable of.

Adam's hands shake.

                    GEOFF (CONT'D)
          That kid. Tyson? He's what, sixteen? Moosk could find him in twenty minutes. The girl, Gal - even faster. That
          busybody Joe who helped you with the barrel?

Adam lunges forward.

Moosk catches him mid-step. One hand. Effortless.

Lifts Adam off the ground by his shirt collar.

Adam, choking.

                    ADAM
          Let... go...

                    GEOFF
          (calm)
          Put him down.

Moosk releases Adam. He drops to the floor, gasping.

                    GEOFF (CONT'D)
          You're emotional. I understand. This work is difficult. But you're good at it, Adam. Better than good.
          Essential.

Adam, on the floor, coughing.

                    ADAM
          I won't do it.

                    GEOFF
          Then people will die. Not me. Not Moosk. Them. Tyson. Gal. Joe. All of them. Because of you.

                    ADAM
          Because of YOU.

                    GEOFF
          No. Because of your choice. I'm offering you a deal: keep working, and they stay safe. Quit, and...
          (shrugs)
          You know the rest.

Adam stares up at Geoff from the floor. Sees the cold certainty in his eyes.

He's trapped. Completely.

Adam, broken.

                    ADAM
          I can't keep doing this...

                    GEOFF
          You can. You will. Because the alternative is watching everyone you care about suffer and die, knowing it's
          your fault.

Geoff straightens his jacket.

                    GEOFF (CONT'D)
          Moosk will contact you about the next job. I expect your usual professionalism.

He gestures to the door.

                    GEOFF (CONT'D)
          You can go.

Adam slowly gets to his feet. Legs shaking.

Geoff sits back down at his desk. Picks up his tablet. Already bored again.

                    GEOFF (CONT'D)
          Oh, and Adam?

Adam stops at the door. Doesn't turn around.

                    GEOFF (CONT'D)
          Don't try anything stupid. I have eyes everywhere. Heh-heh-heh.

Moosk's red eyes glow brighter for a moment.

Adam opens the door and leaves.

EXT. AMAZING COMPANY HEADQUARTERS - DAY

Adam exits the building, walking through the pristine lobby and out into the sunlight.

The city bustles around him. Cars. People in business suits. Normal life.

He stands on the sidewalk, breathing hard.

Trapped.

Can't quit. Can't run. Can't tell anyone.

And everyone he cares about - Tyson, Gal, Joe, all of Tracktown - is now a hostage.

He thought he could escape this. Build a life. A community.

Now that community is his prison.

Adam's expression shifts.

The desperation fades.

Something colder settles in.

If he can't quit...

He'll have to eliminate the problem.

Permanently.

Adam starts walking back toward Tracktown.

But his mind is already working.

Planning.

FADE OUT.
