# Scene 12 - The Wrong Drop-Off

## LOCATION
INT. AMAZING COMPANY AUTO-CAR / EXT. AMAZING COMPANY SHIPPING FACILITY - NIGHT

## CHARACTERS
Adam, Body (chopped up in bags)

## SCENE LAYOUT

### Opening
Adam sits in the back of an Amazing Company auto-car, exhausted and distracted. Multiple black bags containing chopped
body parts are in the cargo area. He's going through the motions - this has become routine. Through the window, he spots
a police car parked on the side of the road, triggering instant paranoia.

### Key Beats
1. **Police sighting** - Adam tenses when he sees the cop car, but the auto-car turns a corner
2. **Being followed?** - Vehicles turn after him. Adam's paranoia spikes - is he being followed or is it coincidence?
Can't see colors in the dark.
3. **Wrong destination** - The auto-car arrives at a massive, well-lit Amazing Company shipping facility instead of the
railyard. The automated voice reveals the wrong destination.
4. **Panic and correction** - Adam frantically checks the app (which now shows the wrong destination) and corrects it
back to Tracktown
5. **Mystery** - Was this a random glitch, Geoff testing him, or his luck finally running out?

### Character Moments
- **Adam**: Exhausted and on autopilot from too many disposal jobs. The police sighting jolts him back to reality,
reminding him how precarious his situation is. When vehicles appear to be following him (he can't see their colors in the
dark), his paranoia explodes. At the wrong facility, he experiences pure terror - one wrong move and he's caught with
chopped bodies. The ambiguity of what caused the glitch leaves him more paranoid than ever.

### Closing
The auto-car reroutes to the correct destination. Adam sits in silence, heart pounding, staring at the bags. He's
rattled. The system that's protected him might be breaking down - or someone might be playing games with him. Either way,
the walls are closing in.

## FULL SCRIPT

INT. AMAZING COMPANY AUTO-CAR - NIGHT

The self-driving car glides through empty streets. ADAM slumps in the back seat, eyes half-closed. Exhausted. Going
through the motions.

In the cargo area behind him: FOUR BLACK PLASTIC BAGS, heavy and misshapen.

Adam stares out the window, unfocused. The city blurs past.

Through the windshield, up ahead: a POLICE CAR parked on the roadside, lights off.

Adam's eyes snap open. He sits up straight.

Adam, under his breath.

                    ADAM
          No no no...

The auto-car maintains its steady speed. Drawing closer to the police car.

Adam's hand hovers over the door handle. His breathing quickens.

The police car sits dark. Empty? Occupied? Impossible to tell.

Adam glances back at the bags. If they pull him over--

The auto-car turns right, away from the police car.

Adam exhales, slumping back.

Adam (cont'd), quietly.

                    ADAM (CONT'D)
          Just keep moving. Just keep--

Through the rear window: HEADLIGHTS turn the corner behind them.

A vehicle. Can't see the color in the dark. Can't see what kind.

Adam watches it. Probably nothing. Random traffic.

The vehicle maintains distance. Following? Or just... driving?

Another turn. The vehicle follows.

Adam's jaw tightens. He checks the app on his phone.

DESTINATION: TRACKTOWN INDUSTRIAL - EAST ENTRANCE
ETA: 8 MINUTES

The screen shows their route. Normal.

He looks back. The headlights are still there.

Another vehicle turns onto the street behind them. More headlights. Two cars now.

                    ADAM (CONT'D)
          What the hell...

His fingers tighten on the phone. Two vans now. Both keeping pace.

Coincidence. Has to be. Vans drive at night. It's normal.

But nothing has felt normal for weeks.

The auto-car takes another turn. Adam holds his breath.

Both vans turn too.

Adam (cont'd), frantic whisper.

                    ADAM (CONT'D)
          They're following me. Geoff's testing me. Or the police--

He grips his phone. Wants to check the route again but forces himself to look away.

Don't draw attention. Act normal.

The auto-car slows.

Through the windshield: MASSIVE FLOODLIGHTS illuminate an enormous industrial facility. Security gates. Loading docks.
Workers in bright vests moving between buildings.

The Amazing Company logo gleams on every surface.

                    ADAM (CONT'D)
          Oh god. Oh god oh god--

The auto-car pulls into the entrance lane, heading for the security checkpoint.

Automated voice, from car speakers.

                    AUTOMATED VOICE
          Arriving at destination: Amazing Company Central Shipping Hub.

Adam, panicked.

                    ADAM
          What? When did I-- I didn't change--

He frantically opens the app on his phone.

The screen shows: AMAZING COMPANY CENTRAL SHIPPING HUB

                    ADAM (CONT'D)
          NO!

His fingers fly over the screen. CHANGE DESTINATION. He scrolls through recent addresses.

The auto-car continues toward the checkpoint. Twenty yards away. Fifteen.

Adam finds it: TRACKTOWN INDUSTRIAL - EAST ENTRANCE.

He slams the selection.

UPDATE DESTINATION? YES / NO

He hits YES.

The auto-car slows. Stops.

                    AUTOMATED VOICE (CONT'D)
          Recalculating route.

Adam stares at the security checkpoint fifteen feet away. A GUARD in the booth looks up from his monitor.

Their eyes meet.

Adam forces a casual wave.

The guard nods back, uninterested.

                    AUTOMATED VOICE (CONT'D)
          New route confirmed. Estimated arrival: 12 minutes.

The auto-car reverses, turns, heads back to the main road.

Adam collapses against the seat, heart hammering.

He looks back at the facility, shrinking in the distance.

The vans are gone. The street is empty.

Were they even real? Or paranoia playing tricks?

Adam stares at his phone. The app shows the corrected route. Simple. Clean.

No indication of why it changed.

Random glitch? The system malfunctioning?

Or...

He thinks of Geoff. That titter laugh. Those cold eyes.

Was this a test? A game? A warning?

Adam looks at the bags in the cargo area.

Adam, barely audible.

                    ADAM
          What's happening...

The auto-car drives on through the night.

Adam doesn't sleep. Doesn't relax.

He watches every car. Every shadow.

Waiting for the next thing to go wrong.

FADE OUT.
