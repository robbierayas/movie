# Scene 17 - Creating the Gas

## LOCATION
INT. TRACKTOWN STORE / INT. RAILYARD - SECRET CHAMBER - NIGHT

## CHARACTERS
Adam, Store Cashier, Rat

## SCENE LAYOUT

### Opening
Adam buys a rat from the Tracktown store - wordless transaction, just visual shots of him waiting in line and the cashier handing over a cage with the rat. Then he descends into his secret underground chamber - the same place he's been disposing bodies. Surrounded by his chemistry equipment, acids, compounds. This is his domain, where his expertise means something. He's made a decision: if he can't quit, he has to eliminate Geoff.

### Key Beats
1. **The Purchase** - Wordless scene: Adam buys a rat from Tracktown store. Visual only, no dialogue.
2. **The Plan** - Adam begins working on a deadly gas. Something that can kill Geoff discreetly. His chemistry knowledge
finally weaponized for himself instead of just disposal.
3. **Testing compounds** - Experiments with different chemical combinations, taking notes. The methodical scientist at
work.
4. **The Rat Test** - Tests on the rat. The rat dies quickly - success!
5. **The Flaw** - But then the rat's heart starts beating again. It moves, erratic and wrong. The re-animator gas has an
unintended side effect.
6. **Time Runs Out** - Adam tries to fix the formula, remove the reanimation flaw. But he's running out of time. Geoff
will summon him soon for another job.
7. **The Decision** - Adam decides to use the gas anyway. It kills, then reanimates. Not ideal, but it's his only option.

### Character Moments
- **Adam**: Transformed from desperate victim to active planner. His chemistry skills - which have been used for evil -
are now his weapon. Methodical, focused, determined. The reanimation flaw troubles him, but desperation wins. He's
crossing a line: from disposal to murder. But in his mind, it's self-defense and defense of his community.

### Closing
Adam seals the gas in a small container - possibly a pill or capsule that can release the gas when activated. He has his
weapon. Now he just needs the opportunity to use it. The scientist has become the assassin.

## FULL SCRIPT

INT. TRACKTOWN STORE - NIGHT

A cramped corner store. Mismatched shelves. Flickering fluorescent lights.

ADAM stands in a short line behind two other people. He's quiet, expressionless.

The line moves forward.

A CASHIER (40s, tired) sits behind a scratched plexiglass barrier.

The person in front of Adam finishes their purchase. Leaves.

Adam steps up to the counter.

Points at something behind the cashier.

The cashier turns. Reaches for a small WIRE CAGE hanging on the wall.

Inside: a WHITE RAT, sniffling, alert.

The cashier sets the cage on the counter.

Adam pulls out his phone. Taps it against the cashier's phone. Payment confirmed.

The cashier slides the cage through the opening in the barrier.

Adam takes it. Looks at the rat.

The rat looks back. Innocent. Unaware.

Adam turns and walks out.

INT. RAILYARD - SECRET CHAMBER - NIGHT

Darkness. Then a light flickers on.

Adam descends the ladder into his underground lab. The same chamber where he's dissolved countless bodies.

Equipment lines the walls. Chemicals. Acids. Beakers. Burners.

Tools of disposal.

Tonight, tools of murder.

Adam sets down the rat cage. The rat sniffles, exploring its enclosure.

He opens his NOTEBOOK. Flips past pages of disposal notes to a blank section.

Writes at the top: "PROJECT TERMINATION"

He stares at the words.

Then begins.

MONTAGE - CREATING THE GAS

- Adam mixes compounds. Purple liquid into clear. It fizzes, turns green.

- Tests with litmus paper. Wrong pH. He adjusts.

- Heats a beaker over a burner. Yellow vapor rises.

- Captures the vapor in a sealed container.

- Takes notes: formulas, measurements, observations.

- Hours pass. Empty coffee cup multiplies into three. Four.

- Finally: a small vial of CLEAR LIQUID.

Adam holds it up to the light.

INT. RAILYARD - SECRET CHAMBER - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

Adam approaches the rat cage with the vial.

The rat watches him, curious.

Adam, softly.

                    ADAM
          I'm sorry.

He opens a tiny valve on the vial. Vapor escapes - invisible, odorless.

The rat sniffs.

Continues sniffing normally.

Then stops.

Wobbles.

Falls over.

Adam watches, stopwatch in hand.

                    ADAM (CONT'D)
          Eleven seconds. Too slow.

He makes a note.

The rat lies still. Dead.

Adam stares at it.

He's done it. Created a lethal gas.

He did it. He--

The rat TWITCHES.

Adam leans closer.

Another twitch. Then its tiny chest moves.

UP.

DOWN.

The rat's heart is beating again.

                    ADAM (CONT'D)
          What...?

The rat jerks upright. Its movements are wrong. Spastic. Mechanical.

It slams into the cage wall. Again. Again.

No awareness. No pain response. Just... movement.

                    ADAM (CONT'D)
          No no no--

The rat continues its erratic thrashing.

Adam opens his notebook. Reviews his formula.

                    ADAM (CONT'D)
          The neural inhibitor... if the dosage is wrong, the autonomic system could restart before brain death is
          complete...

He scribbles calculations.

                    ADAM (CONT'D)
          Compound B needs to be increased. No, decreased. Bind the--

The rat slams into the cage again. CRACK. Its neck breaks.

It keeps moving.

Adam stares, horrified.

Adam (cont'd), quietly.

                    ADAM (CONT'D)
          What did I make...

He works for hours. Adjusting. Testing.

Each iteration: the rat dies. Then reanimates. Always erratic. Always wrong.

Dawn light begins creeping through cracks in the chamber ceiling.

Adam slumps against the wall. Exhausted.

His phone buzzes.

He checks it.

MESSAGE FROM MOOSK: "Job tonight. 8pm. Sending location."

Adam looks at his vial of gas. Still flawed. Still reanimating.

Then at the clock.

No time to fix it.

He has to choose: abandon the plan, or use what he has.

Adam seals the gas in a small CAPSULE - something easily concealed.

Adam turns to himself.

                    ADAM
          It kills. That's what matters.

He pockets the capsule.

The reanimation... that's Geoff's problem. Not his.

Adam climbs the ladder, leaving his lab.

Leaving the dead rat still twitching in its cage.

The scientist has become the assassin.

And he's ready.

FADE OUT.
