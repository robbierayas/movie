## SCREENPLAY

EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD BODEGA - AFTERNOON

A small store near the railyard. Worn but functional. Serves the homeless and working poor.

Adam and Tyson approach. Adam checks his phone - the grocery list.

                    ADAM
          Coffee. Marie specifically asked for coffee.

                    TYSON
          This place has everything. Well, everything cheap.

They enter.

INT. BODEGA - CONTINUOUS

Cramped aisles. Basic supplies. A SHOPKEEPER (60s) behind bulletproof glass at the counter.

Adam walks to the coffee section. Scans the shelf.

Instant coffee. Generic brands. The cheap stuff.

But the specific brand Marie asked for - sold out. Empty spot on the shelf.

Adam, muttering.

                    ADAM
          Come on...

At the counter, a WOMAN (GAL, late 20s, worn clothes but carrying herself with quiet confidence) completes a purchase.

She holds a bag. Inside: the exact coffee Adam is looking for.

Adam walks to the counter. Sees the coffee in her bag.

Adam (cont'd) turns to Gal.

                    ADAM (CONT'D)
          Excuse me. That coffee - did you just buy the last one?

Gal, glancing at bag.

                    GAL
          Yeah. Why?

                    ADAM
          I promised someone I'd get it. That specific brand.

Gal smiles.

                    GAL
          So did I.

They look at each other. Impasse.

Tyson turns to Adam.

                    TYSON
          Just get a different kind.

Adam shakes their head.

                    ADAM
          I told Marie I'd get this one. She asked for it specifically.

Gal, studying him.

                    GAL
          Keeping your word matters, huh?

                    ADAM
          Yeah. It does.

Gal considers this. Looks at Adam more carefully. Sees something genuine.

Gal turns to Adam.

                    GAL
          I'll make you a deal. You buy me anything else in this store - anything I want - and the coffee's yours.

Adam, immediately.

                    ADAM
          Done.

Gal, surprised.

                    GAL
          You didn't even ask what I'd pick.

Adam, shrugging.

                    ADAM
          Doesn't matter. I said I'd get the coffee. So whatever you need, it's yours.

Gal stares at him. Then smiles - genuine warmth.

                    GAL
          Alright. You're either the most honest person I've met in years, or you're running a really weird scam.

Tyson laughs.

                    TYSON
          He's honest. Painfully honest.

Gal hands Adam the coffee. He takes it like it's treasure.

Gal walking back into store.

                    GAL
          Come on, then. Let's see if you regret this.

Adam and Tyson follow. Gal browses, testing him. Picks up expensive items, watches his reaction.

Adam, patient.

                    ADAM
          Whatever you want.

Gal, picking up toiletries.

                    GAL
          These. And bread. And soup.

Adam nods.

                    ADAM
          Done.

Gal watches him. This man is serious.

Gal, quieter.

                    GAL
          Why's it matter so much? The coffee?

                    ADAM
          Because someone asked me to get it. And I haven't been good at keeping promises lately. So when I can... I do.

Something in his voice. Past regrets. Gal understands that.

They go to the counter. Adam pays for everything - Gal's items and the rest of his list.

The shopkeeper bags it all.

Outside, Adam holds up the coffee.

Adam (cont'd) turns to Gal.

                    ADAM (CONT'D)
          Thank you. Really.

Gal smiles.

                    GAL
          You paid for it.

                    ADAM
          Still. You didn't have to trade.

Tyson watches them, grinning.

Tyson turns to Gal.

                    TYSON
          I'm T, by the way. That's Adam.

                    GAL
          Gal.

Adam, idea forming.

                    ADAM
          Hey... want to meet them? The people I'm getting this for?

Gal, surprised.

                    GAL
          What?

                    ADAM
          We're having a barbecue. Community thing. You're welcome to come.

Gal hesitates. Then nods.

                    GAL
          Yeah. Sure. Why not?

EXT. RAILYARD - ENCAMPMENT - LATE AFTERNOON

Adam, Tyson, and Gal walk back together. Easy conversation developing.

Tyson, telling story.

                    TYSON
          -so I'm like, "That's not my medicine, that's yours!" And the guy just PAYS me to go away!

Gal laughs. Adam laughs too.

Gal turns to Adam.

                    GAL
          You run scams?

                    ADAM
          Used to. Long time ago.

                    TYSON
          He's better now. Does chemistry magic.

Gal, intrigued.

                    GAL
          Chemistry magic?

Adam smiles.

                    ADAM
          I'll show you sometime.

They arrive at the barbecue. The community from Scene 9, still gathered.

JOE spots them.

                    JOE
          Adam! You made it back! And brought friends!

Marie, seeing the coffee.

                    MARIE
          You got it! Thank you!

Adam, handing it over.

                    ADAM
          Told you I would.

He introduces Gal and Tyson (again for the community) to everyone. Natural welcomes. Plates of food passed around.

The three sit together - Adam, Tyson, Gal - on a bench. Eating, talking, laughing.

AT THE BARBECUE:

Gal watches the community. Sees the warmth, the support system.

Gal turns to Adam.

                    GAL
          This is nice. You've got a good thing here.

Adam, looking around.

                    ADAM
          Yeah. I do.

Tyson tells another story. Both Adam and Gal laugh.

Adam looks at them - Tyson's energy, Gal's smile. Feels something he hasn't felt in years.

Belonging.

Joe, approaching with more food.

                    JOE
          You three look good together. Friends?

Adam smiles.

                    ADAM
          Yeah. Friends.

Gal and Tyson exchange a look. Smile.

Tyson, grinning.

                    TYSON
          Damn right.

Gal, raising cup.

                    GAL
          To friends.

They toast - makeshift cups of water.

The sun sets behind them. The railyard community continues around them.

For the first time in years, Adam is not alone.

He has people. He has a place. He has friends.

This is what he's been building.

This is what he has to lose.

The three of them together, smiling, belonging.

FADE TO BLACK.

END ACT 1
