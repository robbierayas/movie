## SCREENPLAY

EXT. MEGA GYM COMPLEX - DAY

A massive building - glass and steel, gleaming. AMAZING COMPANY logo prominent. Half gym, half cafeteria, all status
symbol.

Adam approaches, still wearing the same worn clothes. He looks small against the building's scale.

People stream in and out. The wealthy wear designer athletic wear. The mid-class wear cheaper versions. The poor wear
whatever they have.

The class hierarchy is visible in everything.

INT. MEGA GYM - ENTRANCE - DAY

Inside, the segregation is stark.

To the right: Premium area. Pool sparkling. Sauna. Massage chairs. Smoothie bar. Beautiful people in expensive clothes
lounging, socializing.

Center: Mid-tier facilities. Treadmills, weights, basic equipment. People working out seriously, trying to maintain
middle-class health.

To the left: Basic services. A single counter with a BORED ATTENDANT. Sign above: "HOT WATER - $2 PER 12OZ / SHOWERS -
$15 / POOL ACCESS - PREMIUM ONLY"

Adam goes left. Gets in line behind other poor people. Some homeless, some working poor. All here for the bare minimum.

AT THE COUNTER:

Adam reaches the front. Pulls out crumpled bills.

Adam, quiet.

                    ADAM
          Two cups. Hot water.

The attendant takes the money without looking up. Dispenses two 12-ounce cups of hot water from a tap.

Attendant, monotone.

                    ATTENDANT
          Towels are fifty cents extra.

                    ADAM
          Just the water.

Adam takes the cups to a corner sink area. Other poor people do the same - using the small amount of hot water to wash
faces, hands, necks. Desperate hygiene.

Adam wets his hands, scrubs his face. The water barely does anything. He looks at himself in the grimy mirror.

Still obviously unhoused. Still obviously poor.

Behind him, in the reflection, the wealthy walk past toward their premium facilities. They don't even glance at the poor
section.

Invisible.

EXT. MEGA GYM - DESIGNATED PICKUP AREA - DAY

Adam exits the gym, slightly cleaner but not much. He checks the address on Geoff's business card.

An Amazing Company auto-car pulls up. No driver. The door opens automatically.

The screen inside displays: "PASSENGER: ADAM. DESTINATION: GEOFF RESIDENCE."

Face recognition. The car knew it was him.

Adam hesitates, then gets in. The door closes. The car drives itself away.

INT. AUTO-CAR - DAY

Adam sits rigidly. Watches the city pass through the window.

The landscape changes. Poorer districts give way to wealthier ones. Buildings get taller, cleaner. Auto-cars get newer,
more expensive.

They're entering a completely different world.

EXT. GEOFF'S BUILDING - DAY

A luxury high-rise. Doorman. Valet service for auto-cars. Everything pristine.

The car stops. Door opens.

Doorman, polite but cold.

                    DOORMAN
          Delivery entrance is around back.

Adam, showing card.

                    ADAM
          I have an appointment. With Geoff.

The doorman's expression changes. Surprise, then careful neutrality.

Doorman, checking device.

                    DOORMAN
          Yes. You're expected. Penthouse level.

Adam walks through the lobby. Marble floors. His worn shoes squeak. Everyone stares.

INT. PENTHOUSE - GEOFF'S HOME OFFICE - DAY

Massive space. Floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the city. Expensive everything.

Geoff sits casually in a designer chair. Moosk stands motionless nearby, watching.

Adam enters, overwhelmed by the wealth on display.

Geoff, cheerful.

                    GEOFF
          There he is! The man of the hour!
          (titter laugh)
          Heh-heh-heh!

Adam, carefully.

                    ADAM
          You wanted to see me.

                    GEOFF
          I wanted to PAY you. Big difference!
          (stands, walks to desk)
          You did excellent work. I had someone check - no trace whatsoever. Very impressive.

Geoff opens a drawer. Pulls out a thick envelope. Sets it on the desk.

                    GEOFF (CONT'D)
          Five thousand dollars. Cash. Our agreement.

Adam stares at the envelope. Five thousand dollars. More money than he's seen in years.

                    GEOFF (CONT'D)
          Go ahead. Count it if you want. I won't be offended.

Adam approaches slowly. Picks up the envelope. Feels the weight.

Adam, quiet.

                    ADAM
          This is... a lot of money.

Geoff laughs.

                    GEOFF
          For you, maybe! For me?
          (dismissive wave)
          Pocket change. Rounding error.

Adam opens the envelope. Real bills. All there.

Geoff (cont'd), sitting back.

                    GEOFF (CONT'D)
          I want to hire you again. Regularly. Same arrangement - you dispose, I pay. Clean, professional, no
          complications.

Adam, cautious.

                    ADAM
          How often?

Geoff, shrugging.

                    GEOFF
          Depends. When I need it. Could be twice a week. Could be once a month.
          (titter laugh)
          Heh-heh-heh. Hard to predict these things.

                    ADAM
          Why are you doing this? The killing?

Silence.

Geoff's smile fades slightly. He looks at Adam with genuine curiosity.

                    GEOFF
          You really want to know?

Adam nods.

                    ADAM

Geoff stands. Walks to the window. Looks out at the city he controls.

                    GEOFF
          I didn't use to like it so much. Killing. Had nightmares. Guilt. All that human weakness.
          (pause)
          But then I realized - why feel bad? I have money. I have power. I can do whatever I want and nobody can stop
          me.
          (turns back)
          Without worry or guilt... I might as well do it while I can. Right?

Adam stares at him. This man is a monster who's convinced himself he's logical.

Geoff (cont'd), cheerful again.

                    GEOFF (CONT'D)
          Plus it's FUN! Like a hobby! Some people collect art, I collect... experiences.
          (titter laugh)
          Heh-heh-heh.

He returns to his desk. Pulls out another envelope - thinner.

                    GEOFF (CONT'D)
          Advance payment. For the next job. Same rate. Interested?

Adam looks at the money in his hand. Thinks about the railyard. The people struggling there. What this money could do.

Thinks about his poverty. His isolation. His inability to help anyone including himself.

This money could change everything.

Adam, hollow.

                    ADAM
          Same arrangement. Just disposal.

Geoff, satisfied.

                    GEOFF
          Of course! I do the fun part. You do the cleanup.
          (extends hand)
          Partners?

Adam doesn't take his hand.

                    ADAM
          This is business. Not partnership.

Geoff, amused.

                    GEOFF
          Fair enough.
          (withdraws hand)
          Moosk will contact you when there's a new job. Could be tomorrow, could be next week.

Moosk's head turns toward Adam. Those red eyes scanning. Memorizing.

Adam turns to Geoff.

                    ADAM
          Same payment every time?

Geoff nods.

                    GEOFF
          Five thousand per job. Plus transportation, access to any equipment you need. Very generous, considering.

Adam pockets both envelopes. Turns to leave.

Geoff (cont'd), calling after him.

                    GEOFF (CONT'D)
          Oh! One more thing!

Adam stops.

                    GEOFF (CONT'D)
          That gym has showers, right? Fifteen dollars?
          (pulls out a hundred dollar bill)
          You can afford them now.
          (titter laugh)
          Heh-heh-heh. You're welcome!

Adam takes the bill. Says nothing. Leaves.

Moosk watches him go with blank mechanical eyes.

INT. MEGA GYM - SHOWER AREA - DAY

Adam enters a shower stall. Normal shower head above him. A clear container mounted on the wall - marked 12 oz.

He hits the payment button. The container fills with water.

Adam turns the shower valve. Water flows from the shower head - he can control the flow, make it last.

He adjusts it to a gentle stream. Soap. Shampoo borrowed from a dispenser.

The water runs over him. Washing away dirt and grime from weeks, maybe months. He carefully controls the flow, making
every ounce count.

But it can't wash away what he's agreed to.

He closes his eyes. Water streams down his face.

This money will help the community. Will help him survive. Maybe even help him get out eventually.

But he knows the truth.

He's not getting out.

He's getting deeper.

The container empties. The water stops.

FADE TO BLACK.
