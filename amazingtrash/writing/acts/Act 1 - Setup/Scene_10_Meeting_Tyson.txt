## SCREENPLAY

EXT. CITY STREET - STANDARD DISTRICT - AFTERNOON

Adam walks down a busy street, checking his phone. The grocery list from Scene 9. Focused, purposeful.

Ahead, a commotion.

A BUSINESSMAN (40s, wealthy, distracted) walks past a TEENAGER - TYSON, "T" (16-17, scrappy, quick eyes).

Tyson is holding a small bottle. Drops it near the businessman's foot.

CLINK. The bottle hits the ground, bouncing but not breaking.

Tyson, loud, panicked.

                    TYSON
          HEY! Watch it!

The businessman stops, confused.

                    BUSINESSMAN
          What?

                    TYSON
          You almost stepped on my medicine! It needs disinfecting now!

Adam slows, watching. He's seen this scam before.

Businessman, annoyed.

                    BUSINESSMAN
          I didn't step on anything -

Tyson, picking up bottle, examining.

                    TYSON
          There's street dirt on it! Do you know how expensive this is? I need to get it cleaned now!

The businessman looks around. People watching. He just wants out of this situation.

                    BUSINESSMAN
          How much?

                    TYSON
          Cleaning costs... twenty bucks.

Adam smiles slightly. Classic hustle.

The businessman pulls out his wallet. Hands over twenty.

Businessman, muttering.

                    BUSINESSMAN
          Just go.

Tyson pockets the money, nods seriously.

                    TYSON
          I'll take it to the old jester down the way, get it properly -

Adam, finishing the line.

                    ADAM
          - and he'll charge you three copper for the service.

Tyson spins around. Sees Adam standing there.

Silence.

Tyson, wary.

                    TYSON
          You know that one?

Adam nods.

                    ADAM
          Used to run it myself. Long time ago.

The businessman walks away quickly, glad to escape.

Tyson studies Adam. Sees the worn but clean clothes. The tired but intelligent eyes.

Tyson, curious.

                    TYSON
          What's your hustle now?

Adam, hesitating.

                    ADAM
          Chemistry.

Tyson, unimpressed.

                    TYSON
          Chemistry? What's that good for?

Adam considers. Then pulls out two small vials from his pocket - powder chemicals he uses for disposal work.

Adam smiles.

                    ADAM
          Let me show you.

He pours a small amount of each powder into his palm.

                    ADAM (CONT'D)
          In the old days, they thought this was magic.

He rubs his palms together.

WHOOSH.

A flash of fire erupts from his hands. Brief, controlled, harmless.

Tyson jumps back, eyes wide.

                    TYSON
          Holy SHIT!

Adam brushes off his hands, the fire already gone.

Tyson (cont'd), amazed.

                    TYSON (CONT'D)
          Do it again!

Adam shakes their head.

                    ADAM
          Don't have enough on me. But that's the idea.

Tyson laughs.

                    TYSON
          That's way cooler than my scam! Can you teach me?

                    ADAM
          Maybe. Depends.

                    TYSON
          On what?

Adam pulls Tyson's phone from his own pocket. Holds it up.

Adam smiles.

                    ADAM
          On whether you notice when someone's using misdirection.

Tyson's jaw drops. Pats his empty pocket.

                    TYSON
          You PICKPOCKETED me? During the fireball?

Adam, handing phone back.

                    ADAM
          Also good for misdirection.

Tyson stares at him. Then bursts out laughing. Genuine, delighted laughter.

                    TYSON
          Okay, okay. You're good. You're REALLY good.

Adam laughs.

                    ADAM
          You're not bad yourself.

They stand there, grinning at each other. Mutual recognition. Mutual respect.

Tyson, extending hand.

                    TYSON
          I'm Tyson. Everyone calls me T.

Adam shakes their head.

                    ADAM
          Adam.

                    TYSON
          So where you headed, Adam?

Adam, checking phone.

                    ADAM
          Store. Getting stuff for some people in my community.

Tyson nods.

                    TYSON
          Cool. I'll walk with you.

Adam looks surprised. Then pleased.

                    ADAM
          Yeah. Sure.

They start walking together. Tyson bouncing with energy, Adam more measured but smiling.

                    TYSON
          So the chemistry thing - where'd you learn that?

                    ADAM
          University. Long time ago.

                    TYSON
          What happened?

Adam, carefully.

                    ADAM
          Life happened. You?

Tyson, shrugging.

                    TYSON
          Tracktown raised me. Been hustling since I was eight. It's just what you do.

Adam, quiet.

                    ADAM
          Yeah. I know.

They walk in comfortable silence for a moment.

                    TYSON
          So you got people? A community?

Adam nods.

                    ADAM
          Railyard settlement. Yours?

                    TYSON
          Tracktown. It's... yeah, it's home.

Something in Tyson's voice - pride mixed with resignation. This is his normal. Has been his whole life.

Tyson (cont'd), brightening.

                    TYSON (CONT'D)
          Hey, you should meet my friend Gal sometime. She's cool. Smart like you.

Adam, surprised by the invitation.

                    ADAM
          Yeah. Maybe.

Tyson, grinning.

                    TYSON
          Definitely. Anyone who can do fire magic and pickpocket people? Gal would love you.

Adam laughs. Real laughter. When was the last time he had a conversation like this? Just... normal?

Adam smiles.

                    ADAM
          Alright. I'd like that.

They continue walking. Two street-smart survivors who found each other by chance.

Maybe even friends.

FADE TO BLACK.
