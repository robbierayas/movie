## SCREENPLAY

INT. AMAZING COMPANY AUTO-CAR - NIGHT

The interior is pristine. Sleek leather seats, touchscreen controls glowing soft blue, ambient lighting. Everything
expensive and new.

Adam sits rigid in the passenger seat, hands gripping his knees. His worn clothes look jarring against the luxury.

The car drives itself - no steering wheel, no pedals. Just smooth autonomous movement through city streets.

Behind the seats: the cargo area. A large bundle wrapped in dark plastic sheeting lies there. The shape is unmistakable
if you know what you're looking at.

Adam doesn't turn around. Stares straight ahead. His breathing is shallow.

EXT. TRACKTOWN PERIMETER - NIGHT (THROUGH WINDSHIELD)

The auto-car approaches a checkpoint. Simple setup: barriers across the road, portable lights, a couple of folding
chairs. Nothing official.

Two GUARDS stand watch - wearing black vests over regular clothes. No badges, no uniforms. Just the vests marking them as
Tracktown night patrol.

GUARD KANE (40s, tired) holds up a hand. The auto-car slows automatically.

GUARD REED (30s, newer to patrol) steps forward with a flashlight.

The auto-car's display shows: "CHECKPOINT STOP."

Adam, whisper.

                    ADAM
          No no no...

The car stops at the barrier.

Adam's hands shake. He forces them still.

The guards approach the auto-car, one on each side. Kane taps the window. It slides down automatically.

                    GUARD KANE
          Evening. Checkpoint security. Where you coming from?

Adam, carefully.

                    ADAM
          Tracktown. I live in Tracktown.

Guard Reed shines a flashlight through the passenger side window, scanning the interior. The beam passes over Adam's
face, making him squint.

                    GUARD KANE
          Step out of the vehicle, please.

Adam's heart hammers. He opens the door, steps out onto the pavement.

Guard Kane examines him - the worn clothes, the nervous energy, the fact he doesn't belong in a luxury vehicle.

                    GUARD KANE (CONT'D)
          What are you doing in an Amazing Company auto-car?

Adam, forcing calm.

                    ADAM
          I was offered a job. With the company. This is - employee transport. A perk.

Silence.

Guard Reed circles the car, still shining his flashlight through windows. Checking the cargo area.

Adam's blood turns to ice. The flashlight beam passes over the wrapped bundle.

Guard reed, calling to Kane.

                    GUARD REED
          There's something in the cargo area.

Guard kane turns to Adam.

                    GUARD KANE
          What's in the back?

Adam, too fast.

                    ADAM
          Equipment. For the job. Chemistry equipment.

                    GUARD KANE
          Chemistry.
          (pause)
          What kind of job involves chemistry equipment at-
          (checks watch)
          -two in the morning?

Adam, desperate.

                    ADAM
          Research position. They need materials moved. I'm starting tomorrow - today - and they wanted me to get
          familiar with the transport system first.

It sounds thin even to him.

Guard Kane studies Adam's face. Looking for tells, for lies, for anything suspicious.

                    GUARD KANE
          Show me your phone. The company app.

Adam pulls out his phone with trembling hands. Opens it.

The screen shows the Amazing Company employee transport app. It's real - Geoff actually set this up. The destination is
logged: Research Facility, Industrial District.

Guard Kane takes the phone. Examines it. Checks the credentials.

Long, terrible silence.

Guard kane (cont'd), thoughtful.

                    GUARD KANE (CONT'D)
          Huh.

He hands the phone back.

Guard reed, joining them.

                    GUARD REED
          Kane, you see this?

                    GUARD KANE
          Yeah. Checks out.

Guard reed turns to Adam, skeptical.

                    GUARD REED
          You really work for Amazing Company? You?

The question stings. The implication clear: someone from Tracktown doesn't get jobs like that.

Adam, quiet.

                    ADAM
          I start today.

Guard kane, softer now.

                    GUARD KANE
          What are you wearing under that jacket?

Adam, confused.

                    ADAM
          What?

                    GUARD KANE
          Your clothes. What else you got?

Adam, understanding.

                    ADAM
          This is it. Everything I own.

He's not lying. Guard Kane sees the truth in it.

Guard kane turns to Reed.

                    GUARD KANE
          Let him through.

Guard reed, protesting.

                    GUARD REED
          But-

Guard kane, firm.

                    GUARD KANE
          Let him through.

Guard Reed steps back, frustrated but obedient.

Guard Kane looks at Adam with something like sympathy now.

Guard kane (cont'd), genuine.

                    GUARD KANE (CONT'D)
          Good for you. Getting out of Tracktown. Amazing Company - that's a real opportunity.

Adam, hollow.

                    ADAM
          Yeah. Real opportunity.

                    GUARD KANE
          We've been checking all vehicles passing through. People have been going missing. Just looking out for the
          community.

Adam nods. Can't speak. The irony is suffocating.

                    GUARD KANE (CONT'D)
          You're free to go. Good luck with the new job.

Adam nods again. Gets back in the auto-car.

The door closes. The window slides up.

Through the glass, Guard Kane gives a small wave - encouragement.

The auto-car's system reactivates: "RESUMING ROUTE."

The barrier lifts. The vehicle pulls smoothly through the checkpoint.

INT. AUTO-CAR - CONTINUOUS

Adam sits frozen for a moment.

Then he exhales. A shuddering, terrified breath he's been holding.

His hands are shaking violently now. He grips his knees to make them stop.

Adam, whisper, to himself.

                    ADAM
          Oh god. Oh god.

He looks at the phone in his lap. The Amazing Company credentials that saved him.

Behind him, in the cargo area, the wrapped body lies undisturbed.

The auto-car drives on through the night, carrying its terrible cargo toward the disposal site.

Adam stares out the window, seeing nothing.

The reality of what he's doing crashes down. Not just disposing of a body. Transporting it through checkpoints. Nearly
getting caught. Being congratulated by Tracktown guards while a corpse sits three feet behind him.

He's in too deep now.

No way out but through.

FADE TO BLACK.
