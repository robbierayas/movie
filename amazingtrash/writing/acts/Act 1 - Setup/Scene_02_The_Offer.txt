## SCREENPLAY

EXT. CITY STREET - ALLEY - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

Adam stands frozen in Moosk's grip, staring at Geoff. The body lies motionless on the pavement between them. Blood pools
on concrete.

Geoff examines Adam with detached curiosity, like a scientist observing an insect.

Geoff, sighing.

                    GEOFF
          Well. This is unfortunate.
          (to Moosk)
          Can't have witnesses wandering around. You know the drill.

Moosk's grip shifts on Adam's arm, moving toward his throat.

Adam, panicking.

                    ADAM
          Wait - WAIT!

Geoff, dismissive.

                    GEOFF
          Nothing personal. Just tidying up.

Adam struggles against Moosk's hold but the robot's strength is absolute. Cold metal fingers close around his neck.

Adam, desperate, choking.

                    ADAM
          I can - I can help!

Geoff pauses. Holds up a hand. Moosk stops immediately, fingers still wrapped around Adam's throat but not squeezing.

Geoff, amused.

                    GEOFF
          Help? You?

Adam, gasping.

                    ADAM
          The body - I can get rid of it -

Geoff tilts his head, suddenly interested.

                    GEOFF
          Really.
          (circling Adam)
          And why exactly would you do that?

Adam, desperate.

                    ADAM
          Because you'll kill me if I don't!

Geoff laughs.

                    GEOFF
          Fair point!
          (titter laugh)
          Heh-heh-heh.
          (serious again)
          But why should I trust you? What's stopping you from running straight to the police the moment Moosk lets go?

Adam's eyes dart between Geoff, Moosk, and the alley exit. His mind races.

                    ADAM
          I - I have chemistry training. Equipment. I can dissolve it. Completely. No trace.

That gets Geoff's attention. He stops pacing.

                    GEOFF
          Chemistry training. How... specific.
          (leaning closer)
          What kind of training?

Adam, stammering.

                    ADAM
          University. Research. I - it doesn't matter. I know how to break down organic material. Make it disappear.

                    GEOFF
          And where would you do this miraculous disappearing act?

                    ADAM
          The railyard settlement. Underground. I have access to spaces nobody else knows about.

Geoff considers this. His expression shifts from amused to calculating.

Geoff, thoughtful.

                    GEOFF
          Hidden spaces. Chemistry equipment. Knowledge nobody's looking for in a homeless chemist.
          (titter laugh)
          Heh-heh-heh.
          (to Adam)
          You might actually be useful.

He nods at Moosk. The robot releases Adam's throat but maintains a grip on his arm.

Adam gasps for air, rubbing his neck.

                    GEOFF (CONT'D)
          Alright. I'll take you up on your generous offer. You dispose of this-
          (gestures to body)
          -and if you do a good job, maybe we work together again.

Adam, quickly.

                    ADAM
          Just disposal. I won't help you kill anyone.

Silence.

Then Geoff bursts out laughing. Genuine amusement this time.

                    GEOFF
          Oh that's RICH! You have MORALS about this!
          (titter laugh)
          Heh-heh-heh!
          (wiping eyes)
          You'll help me hide a murder, help me avoid consequences, help me get away with it... but you won't help with
          the actual killing.
          (shakes head)
          That's the line? Really?

Adam, defensive.

                    ADAM
          Yes.

Geoff, still amused.

                    GEOFF
          Interesting. You're an interesting person, homeless chemistry man.
          (sudden shift to business)
          Fine. Disposal only. I'm very good at the killing part anyway.

Geoff pulls out his phone. Holds it up.

                    GEOFF (CONT'D)
          Smile for the camera!

                    ADAM
          What-

FLASH.

Geoff takes a photo of Adam standing over the body. The composition is damning - Adam clearly visible, body at his feet,
blood on the ground.

Geoff, cheerful.

                    GEOFF
          Insurance! In case you get any ideas about going to the authorities.
          (shows phone)
          See? Crystal clear. You, with a dead body, in an alley. Very incriminating.

Adam stares at the photo. His face goes pale.

Geoff (cont'd), pocketing phone.

                    GEOFF (CONT'D)
          Now! Dispose of my little problem. If you do a good job-
          (pulls out a business card)
          -come see me here. I'll pay you. We'll see about future opportunities.

He holds out the card. Adam doesn't move.

Moosk's grip tightens. A warning.

Adam slowly takes the card. Looks at it. An address in the wealthy district.

                    GEOFF (CONT'D)
          Don't disappoint me! I hate being disappointed.
          (titter laugh)
          Heh-heh-heh.

Geoff turns and walks toward the alley exit. Moosk releases Adam and follows, moving with mechanical precision.

Geoff (cont'd), calling back.

                    GEOFF (CONT'D)
          Oh, and do it tonight! Fresh is easier than ripe, trust me!
          (titter laugh)
          Heh-heh-heh!

Their footsteps fade. Auto-car doors open and close. The sound of a vehicle gliding away.

Silence.

Adam stands alone in the alley. The body lies at his feet.

He looks at the business card in his hand. Then at the body. Then at the card again.

His hands are shaking.

Adam turns to himself, hollow.

                    ADAM
          What did I just do?

He looks around the alley. No one. The city continues beyond the alley entrance - auto-cars passing, distant sounds of
normal life.

But Adam's life is no longer normal.

He crouches beside the body. Stares at the dead person's face.

Adam (cont'd), whisper.

                    ADAM (CONT'D)
          I'm sorry.

Adam grabs the body under the arms. Starts dragging it deeper into the alley, toward a maintenance access door
half-hidden behind dumpsters.

His face shows horror, disgust, desperation.

But he doesn't stop.

He can't stop now.

FADE TO BLACK.
