## SCREENPLAY

EXT. CITY STREET - WEALTHY DISTRICT - NIGHT

Gleaming storefronts. Auto-cars gliding silently past. Everything pristine, expensive, controlled.

Adam walks the sidewalk, clearly out of place. His worn clothes stand in contrast to the polished surroundings. He stays
close to the buildings, trying to blend with shadows.

He pauses at a trash receptacle - one of the smart bins that separate recyclables automatically. Glances around, then
quickly checks inside. Empty. The wealthy district is too clean.

Adam moves on, hands in pockets, eyes scanning for anything useful. He's scavenging, but there's nothing to find here.

From around the corner ahead, voices. One high-pitched, strangely gleeful. The other lower, pleading.

Adam stops. Should walk away. Instead he edges toward the sound.

EXT. ALLEY ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS

Adam reaches the corner. Peers around the wall into a dark alley.

Three figures visible in the dim light:

GEOFF (40s, expensive suit, slight build) stands watching with hands clasped. His face shows anticipation, like a child
about to open a present.

MOOSK - humanoid robot, imposing build, movements unnaturally precise - holds a VICTIM (30s, business attire) by the arm.
The victim is trembling, tears streaming.

On the ground: a pool innertube, brightly colored. Incongruous next to a helium tank.

Geoff, cheerful.

                    GEOFF
          Alright! Let's get you set up. Moosk, if you would?

Moosk moves with mechanical efficiency, forcing the victim to the ground. The victim struggles but it's useless against
robotic strength.

                    VICTIM
          Please - please I have a family - I'll give you anything -

Geoff, dismissive wave.

                    GEOFF
          Oh stop. You think I need your money?
          (giggles)
          No no. This is just... fun.

Adam watches from his hiding spot, frozen. He should run. He doesn't.

Moosk forces the victim's arms and torso through the innertube. The victim fights but Moosk's grip is absolute. The tube
settles around the victim's waist like a flotation device.

                    VICTIM
          What are you doing - what is this -

                    GEOFF
          An experiment! Well, not really. I've done this before. But it's still fun every time.
          (titter laugh)
          Heh-heh-heh.

That laugh - high-pitched, affected, unsettling. Like someone pretending they find something funny but getting the sound
wrong.

Moosk connects a hose from the helium tank to the innertube's valve. The tank makes a sharp HISS as helium begins
flowing.

The innertube inflates rapidly. The victim's eyes widen in horror as the tube expands around their waist.

                    VICTIM
          No - no please - stop -

Geoff, leaning in, fascinated.

                    GEOFF
          Here we go!

The innertube is fully inflated now, enormous. The victim struggles against Moosk's grip but the robot holds them in
place.

Then the physics takes over.

The helium's buoyancy overcomes the victim's weight. Their feet begin to lift off the ground.

Victim, panicking.

                    VICTIM
          HELP! SOMEBODY HELP ME!

The victim flips upside down as the innertube rises, their head now pointing toward the ground, legs kicking uselessly
above. They begin to ascend, slowly at first.

Geoff, clapping.

                    GEOFF
          Beautiful! Just beautiful!

Geoff walks beneath the rising victim, looking up. His face shows pure delight.

                    GEOFF (CONT'D)
          You know what's funny? I used to feel bad about this. Used to have nightmares, guilt, all that messy stuff.
          (titter laugh)
          Heh-heh-heh.
          (shrugs)
          But then I realized - why feel bad? I can do whatever I want. So I might as well enjoy it!

The victim is ten feet up now, still ascending. Their screams echo in the alley.

                    VICTIM
          PLEASE! SOMEBODY! ANYBODY!

Adam presses against the wall, his breathing shallow. His face shows shock, horror, disbelief at what he's witnessing.

Geoff pulls out a small device - a remote control. Points it upward.

                    GEOFF
          Okay, this part's my favorite.
          (presses button)
          Goodbye!

CLICK.

A mechanism on the innertube triggers. The valve opens.

The helium escapes with a loud HISSSSSSS.

The victim stops rising. Hangs in the air for one suspended moment.

Then falls.

The victim screams. Flails. Twenty feet of empty air.

IMPACT.

The body hits the pavement with a sickening CRUNCH. Blood spreads across the concrete.

Geoff tilts his head, examining the result like an artist checking their work.

Geoff (cont'd), satisfied.

                    GEOFF (CONT'D)
          There we go.
          (titter laugh)
          Heh-heh-heh.

Moosk stands motionless, staring at the body with no reaction.

Adam can't breathe. Can't move. Can't process what he just witnessed.

His hand shakes. Bumps against the wall.

SCRAPE.

Metal trash lid rattling.

Geoff's head snaps toward the sound.

Geoff (cont'd), curious.

                    GEOFF (CONT'D)
          Hmm?

Moosk's head turns with mechanical precision toward Adam's hiding spot. Red lights activate in the robot's eyes -
scanning.

Moosk, flat robotic voice.

                    MOOSK
          Motion detected. Human signature.

Adam's eyes go wide. Terror floods his face.

Geoff, delighted.

                    GEOFF
          Oh! We have an audience!
          (calling out)
          Hello there! Don't be shy!

Adam steps back from the corner, about to run.

Moosk moves. Impossibly fast for something that size. In three mechanical strides the robot rounds the corner and grabs
Adam's arm.

Adam tries to pull away but it's like fighting a steel clamp.

Adam, panicking.

                    ADAM
          I didn't see anything - I was just walking - I don't -

Moosk drags Adam back into the alley, presenting him to Geoff.

Geoff, amused, circling Adam.

                    GEOFF
          Look at you. Unhoused, I'd guess? Wrong district for scavenging, friend. The rich don't throw out anything
          good.
          (titter laugh)
          Heh-heh-heh.

Adam, stammering.

                    ADAM
          Please - I won't say anything - I didn't see -

Geoff laughs.

                    GEOFF
          Oh you definitely saw. You watched the whole thing!
          (leans closer)
          What did you think? Honest opinion. Five stars? Three stars?

Adam stares at him, speechless. This man just murdered someone and he's asking for a review.

Geoff (cont'd), sighs.

                    GEOFF (CONT'D)
          You're no fun. Most people at least scream.

Geoff looks down at the body, then back at Adam. His expression shifts - calculating.

Geoff (cont'd), thoughtful.

                    GEOFF (CONT'D)
          Actually... you might be useful. Do you know chemistry?

Adam freezes. That was too specific a question.

Geoff (cont'd), noticing the reaction.

                    GEOFF (CONT'D)
          Ooh, you do! Perfect!
          (titter laugh)
          Heh-heh-heh. This is serendipity!

Adam, desperate.

                    ADAM
          What do you want?

Geoff gestures to the body.

                    GEOFF
          I need this cleaned up. Professionally. And I think you're exactly the person to do it.

                    ADAM
          I'm not - I can't -

Geoff, interrupting, suddenly serious.

                    GEOFF
          You witnessed a murder. Moosk has you on camera.
          (cheerful again)
          So! You can help me dispose of the body, or you can join it. Your choice!
          (titter laugh)
          Heh-heh-heh.

Moosk's grip tightens on Adam's arm. A mechanical warning.

Adam looks at the body. At Geoff's smiling face. At Moosk's blank robotic stare.

He's trapped.

FADE TO BLACK.
