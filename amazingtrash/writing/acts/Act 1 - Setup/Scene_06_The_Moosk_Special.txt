## Key Beats

1. THE ARRIVAL: Adam called to a job
   - Arrives at warehouse location
   - Hears sounds from inside
   - Enters cautiously
   - Not prepared for what he sees

2. THE SCENE: Victim hanging from ceiling
   - Held by wrist restraints suspended from above
   - Already badly beaten
   - Geoff punching the victim
   - But Geoff's punches are weak, ineffective

3. GEOFF'S WEAKNESS: Physical inability
   - Geoff isn't physically strong
   - Tries to punch hard but can't
   - Frustrated by his own weakness
   - Enjoying it anyway
   - Titter laugh between weak punches

4. MOOSK'S WORK: The real damage
   - Moosk has been doing the beating
   - Inhuman strength visible in victim's injuries
   - Mechanical, precise strikes
   - No emotion, just efficiency
   - Geoff watched/directed Moosk to do it

5. THE DYNAMIC: Geoff and Moosk's relationship
   - Moosk does what Geoff can't physically do
   - Geoff enjoys watching and participating
   - Geoff gives orders, Moosk executes
   - Perfect partnership for murder

6. THE DEATH: Victim dies or is already dead
   - May die during the scene
   - Or already dead when Adam arrives
   - Geoff doesn't seem to know/care

7. GETTING IT DOWN: Geoff orders Moosk
   - "Get him down"
   - Moosk rips the body down
   - No care for gentleness
   - Hands break sickeningly
   - Pulled through/broken by the restraints

8. THE DAMAGE: Hands broken but body intact
   - Hands mangled from being hung/ripped down
   - Rest of body looks relatively normal
   - Can still be transported
   - Adam horrified by the brutality
   - But has to take it anyway

9. ADAM'S HORROR: Witnessing this dynamic
   - Sees how Geoff and Moosk work together
   - Realizes the depth of what he's involved in

   - Takes the body

## Visual Elements
- Victim suspended from ceiling
- Geoff's weak, ineffective punches
- Moosk's mechanical precision and strength

- Blood and damage
- Adam's revulsion

## Dialogue Notes
- Geoff's frustrated grunts while punching
- Geoff's titter laugh
- Geoff ordering Moosk: "Get him down"
- Moosk's robotic compliance
- Adam trying not to react

## SCREENPLAY

EXT. INDUSTRIAL DISTRICT - WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

An abandoned warehouse on the edge of the city. No lights except what leaks through broken windows.

An Amazing Company auto-car pulls up. Adam steps out, carrying his equipment bag.

He looks at the warehouse. Nothing on the outside indicates what's happening within.

From inside: muffled sounds. A THUD. Another. Rhythmic.

Adam hesitates. Then walks toward the entrance.

INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

The space is vast, mostly empty. Concrete floor. Metal beams overhead. Industrial hooks and chains hanging from the
ceiling.

In the center, lit by a single work light: the scene.

A VICTIM (30s, unconscious or dead) hangs suspended from ceiling chains. Their wrists are bound in metal restraints
attached to the hooks above. Body sways slightly. Feet dangle two feet off the ground.

GEOFF stands in front of the victim, fists raised. He throws a punch.

THUD.

The punch lands on the victim's ribs. Weak. Ineffective. Like a child hitting a punching bag.

Geoff, grunting with effort.

                    GEOFF
          Ngh!

He punches again. Same weak impact. His arm shakes with the exertion.

Geoff (cont'd), frustrated.

                    GEOFF (CONT'D)
          Come on...

Another punch. This one barely connects. Geoff steps back, breathing hard.

Geoff (cont'd) laughs.

                    GEOFF (CONT'D)
          Heh-heh-heh... pathetic.

He notices Adam standing at the entrance. Brightens immediately.

Geoff (cont'd), cheerful.

                    GEOFF (CONT'D)
          Oh! You're here! Perfect timing!

Adam stares at the scene. The suspended victim. Geoff's flushed face. The obvious violence.

Behind Geoff, MOOSK stands motionless. Watching.

Adam looks more closely at the victim. The face is swollen, barely recognizable. Bones clearly broken. Blood everywhere.

But Geoff's punches couldn't have done that.

Adam, quiet, horrified.

                    ADAM
          What did you do?

Geoff, dismissive.

                    GEOFF
          Me? Not much, honestly. I tried! But I'm not... physically gifted.
          (gestures to Moosk)
          Moosk did the real work. I mostly supervised.

Moosk doesn't react. Just stands there, hands at sides. Those hands - metal and mechanical - are stained with blood.

                    ADAM
          Is he alive?

Geoff, checking.

                    GEOFF
          Hmm?
          (pokes victim)
          Hard to tell. Doesn't really matter at this point.

Adam feels sick. The victim's chest rises - barely. Shallow breathing. Still alive. Dying.

Geoff (cont'd), stretching his arm.

                    GEOFF (CONT'D)
          I wanted to do more myself. Seems fun in movies! But turns out actual violence requires upper body strength.
          (titter laugh)
          Heh-heh-heh. Who knew?

Adam, hollow.

                    ADAM
          You called me to pick this up.

                    GEOFF
          Yes! Another successful collaboration!
          (circling the victim)
          This one talked too much. Business rival. Threatened to expose some... financial irregularities.
          (shrugs)
          Couldn't have that.

He throws another weak punch at the victim's stomach. The body barely moves.

                    GEOFF (CONT'D)
          See? Nothing. No impact. Disappointing.

He turns to Moosk.

                    GEOFF (CONT'D)
          Show him how it's done.

Moosk steps forward. No hesitation. Pulls back its arm - mechanical servos whirring.

Moosk, flat.

                    MOOSK
          Complying.

The punch hits like a piston. CRUNCH. The victim's body flies backward on the chains, swinging violently.

Adam flinches. That sound - ribs breaking like twigs.

Geoff claps.

Geoff, delighted.

                    GEOFF
          See! THAT'S a punch! Perfect form! Perfect power!
          (titter laugh)
          Heh-heh-heh!

The victim hangs limp now. Not breathing. Dead, if they weren't before.

Adam, turning away.

                    ADAM
          I need to... I'll wait outside.

Geoff, surprised.

                    GEOFF
          What? Why?

Adam, firm.

                    ADAM
          I don't watch. I just dispose.

Geoff, considering.

                    GEOFF
          Ah. Your moral line again.
          (amused)
          You know you're already part of this, right? Doesn't matter if you watch or not.

Adam doesn't respond. Starts walking toward the door.

Geoff (cont'd), calling after him.

                    GEOFF (CONT'D)
          Fine, fine! Get him down, Moosk.

Moosk, flat.

                    MOOSK
          Acknowledged.

Adam stops. Looks back despite himself.

Moosk reaches up, grabs the chain above the victim's wrists. Pulls down.

SCREECH of metal. The hook resists for a moment.

Then - CRACK.

The restraints don't release properly. Moosk just rips the body down through them, mechanical strength overwhelming the
mechanism.

The victim's hands - still in the restraints - break. Bones snap as flesh tears. The hands bend at impossible angles,
pulled through metal that wasn't meant to open that way.

The body drops to the concrete floor with a sickening THUD.

Adam's face goes pale.

Geoff, looking at the damage.

                    GEOFF
          Ooh. That's gonna be harder to transport.
          (to Adam)
          Can you still make it work?

Adam stares at the body. The mangled hands. The broken, bloodied form.

Adam, quiet.

                    ADAM
          Yes.

Geoff, cheerful.

                    GEOFF
          Excellent! Same payment, same arrangement. Auto-car's outside with supplies.

He starts walking past Adam toward the exit. Stops beside him.

Geoff (cont'd), conspiratorial.

                    GEOFF (CONT'D)
          Next time I'm going to try a different method. Something that doesn't require so much... exertion.
          (titter laugh)
          Heh-heh-heh. Maybe you have suggestions? Chemistry expert and all?

Adam, cold.

                    ADAM
          No.

Geoff, shrugs.

                    GEOFF
          Worth asking!

He walks out. Moosk follows, leaving bloody boot prints.

Adam is alone with the body.

He closes his eyes. Breathes.

Opens his eyes. Looks at what's left of the victim.

The hands are destroyed. But the rest is intact enough to transport. He can work with this.

He pulls out plastic sheeting from his bag. Lays it on the floor.

Rolls the body onto it, careful not to look at the face.

Adam, whisper, to the body.

                    ADAM
          I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

He begins wrapping. Mechanical movements. Trying not to think.

Trying not to see Moosk's punch replaying in his mind.

Trying not to hear the sound of bones breaking.

But he can't unhear it.

Can't unsee it.

This is what he's part of now.

FADE TO BLACK.
