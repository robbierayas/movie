# SCENE 8 - THE PUBLIC KILL

## Scene Heading
EXT. PUBLIC LOCATION - DAY/EVENING

## Characters
- ADAM
- GEOFF
- MOOSK
- BODY (victim)

## Tone
Tense, escalating stakes, barely controlled panic

## Key Beats

1. THE CALL: Adam summoned for a job
   - Gets message from Geoff
   - Arrives at location
   - Realizes immediately this is different
   - Very public place (plaza, market, event space)

2. THE KILL: Geoff kills in public
   - Doesn't hide it
   - Cameras everywhere
   - Many witnesses around
   - Geoff increasingly reckless
   - Getting worse/more confident

3. THE ORDER: "Figure it out"
   - Geoff tells Adam to handle it
   - Doesn't care about the difficulty
   - Geoff and Moosk leave
   - Adam alone with body in public
   - Panicking internally

4. THE PROBLEM: Too public to move normally
   - People everywhere
   - Security cameras on buildings
   - Can't just drag it away
   - Witnesses saw something
   - Adam needs a solution fast

5. THE IDEA: Make it small
   - Wraps body tightly in rope
   - Forces it into fetal position
   - Waiting for rigor mortis to set in
   - Will make it small enough to box
   - Hides body temporarily while waiting

6. THE BOX: Returns with large box/container
   - Finds shipping box or similar
   - Acts like delivery person
   - Returns to hidden body
   - Tries to fit it in box

7. THE HAND: Doesn't fit completely
   - All of body fits except one hand
   - Sticking out, won't bend
   - Rigor mortis has set in wrong
   - Can't close the box
   - Adam desperate

8. BREAKING RIGOR: Horrible solution
   - Has to break the rigor mortis
   - Forces the hand
   - Hand breaks off at wrist
   - Horrible snapping sound
   - Adam horrified but continues

9. THE HAND DISPOSAL: Separate problem
   - Now has detached hand
   - Puts it in box with body
   - Closes box finally
   - Looks like delivery

10. THE TRANSPORT: Getting to auto-car
    - Carries box like delivery
    - People around, must act normal
    - Box is heavy, awkward
    - Nearly seen multiple times
    - Each step is tension

11. THE AUTO-CAR: Loading it
    - Amazing Company auto-car arrives
    - Must load box without drawing attention
    - People walking by
    - Security camera on corner
    - Barely succeeds

12. THE ESCAPE: Drives away
    - Auto-car leaves with box
    - Adam exhales
    - Realizes Geoff is getting worse
    - This is unsustainable

## Visual Elements
- Public location with foot traffic
- Security cameras visible
- Body wrapped in rope, fetal position
- Large shipping box/container
- The hand breaking off (handled horrifically)
- Adam acting like delivery person
- Near-misses with witnesses
- Multiple moving parts, any could fail

## Dialogue Notes
- Geoff's casual "Figure it out"
- Adam's panicked muttering to himself
- Maybe overhearing witnesses
- Adam talking his way through as "delivery"
- Minimal dialogue - tension through action

## Purpose
- Escalate Geoff's recklessness
- Show Adam getting deeper
- More disposal challenges
- Breaking point approaching
- Public nature increases danger
- Body mutilation raises horror
- Shows Adam's problem-solving under pressure

## Story Position
- Late Act 1, final disposal before shift
- Escalation of difficulty
- Before Adam finds community
- Shows how far he's come/fallen

## Transitions
- IN: From Scene 7 (another disposal job)
- OUT: Adam has money, returns to railyard → Scene 9 (Making Money)

## SCREENPLAY

EXT. PUBLIC PLAZA - EVENING

An open plaza. Shops, restaurants, outdoor seating. People walking, shopping, eating. Normal evening activity in the
city.

Security cameras visible on every corner.

Adam walks through the plaza, checking his phone. A message from Geoff: "Corner of 5th and Plaza St. Now."

He looks around. This is too public. Way too public.

Then he sees them.

At the edge of the plaza, near a closed storefront: GEOFF and MOOSK.

And on the ground: a BODY.

Fresh. Blood pooling.

Witnesses nearby stare, some filming with phones. Nobody approaching yet - shock, fear, disbelief.

Adam's blood runs cold.

Adam, whisper.

                    ADAM
          No. Not here. Not HERE.

He approaches quickly. Geoff sees him, waves cheerfully.

Geoff, loud, unconcerned.

                    GEOFF
          There you are! Perfect timing!

Adam, hissing.

                    ADAM
          What did you DO? There are cameras - people everywhere -

Geoff, shrugging.

                    GEOFF
          Eh. I was in the area. Opportunity presented itself.
          (titter laugh)
          Heh-heh-heh.

Adam, panicking.

                    ADAM
          You can't just - this is PUBLIC -

Geoff, dismissive.

                    GEOFF
          Your problem now! Figure it out.
          (to Moosk)
          Let's go. I'm hungry.

Geoff and Moosk walk away. Casual. Like they just finished shopping.

Adam stares after them. Then at the body. Then at the witnesses.

One person is calling the police. Others backing away.

Adam turns to himself.

                    ADAM
          Oh god. Oh god oh god oh god.

He needs to move. Now.

INT. PLAZA ALLEY - CONTINUOUS

Adam drags the body into a narrow alley between buildings. Out of immediate sight.

His hands shake. Blood on his clothes now.

He pulls out rope from his equipment bag - always carries supplies now.

Wraps the body tightly. Forces the limbs into fetal position. Compressing it, making it smaller.

The body resists - rigor mortis starting to set in.

Adam, muttering.

                    ADAM
          Come on. Bend. Please bend.

He wraps more rope. Tighter. The body is half its original size now. Might fit in a box.

If he can find a box.

EXT. LOADING DOCK - NIGHT

Behind a restaurant. Dumpsters. Shipping crates. Cardboard boxes.

Adam finds a large shipping box - the kind for appliances. Big enough.

He takes it. Heads back to the alley.

EXT. PLAZA ALLEY - CONTINUOUS

Adam returns with the box. Sets it down beside the wrapped body.

Opens the flaps. Starts loading the body inside.

Legs go in. Torso. Head.

Everything fits.

Except -

One hand. Sticking out at the wrist. Won't bend.

Rigor mortis has locked it in position, extended away from the body.

Adam, desperate.

                    ADAM
          No. No, come in. Please.

He pushes. The hand doesn't move. Rigid. Like a statue.

The box won't close with the hand sticking out.

Adam looks around. People could come down this alley any moment. Police sirens in the distance - getting closer.

He has to close this box.

Now.

Adam (cont'd) turns to himself, horrified.

                    ADAM (CONT'D)
          I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

He grabs the wrist. Positions his weight.

PUSH.

SNAP.

The hand breaks off at the wrist. Bone and tissue tearing.

Adam staggers back, the severed hand in his grip. He stares at it.

At what he just did.

Sirens louder now.

No time.

He throws the hand into the box with the rest of the body. Closes the flaps. Tapes them shut.

The box looks normal now. Like furniture. Like nothing.

EXT. PLAZA - CONTINUOUS

Adam emerges from the alley carrying the box. Heavy. Awkward. But he holds it like a delivery person would.

People walk past. Don't look twice.

He's just delivering something.

A SECURITY GUARD approaches, heading toward the plaza entrance where the killing happened.

Adam keeps walking. Steady pace. Don't run. Don't draw attention.

Security guard, into radio.

                    SECURITY GUARD
          Yeah, I'm heading there now. Witnesses say there's blood but no body.

Adam turns a corner. Out of sight.

His heart pounds so hard he can barely breathe.

EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS

Adam walks two blocks. The box gets heavier with each step.

His arms scream. But he doesn't stop.

An Amazing Company auto-car pulls up. Recognizes him.

Door opens.

Adam loads the box into the cargo area. Closes it.

Gets in the passenger seat.

The door closes. Car drives away.

INT. AUTO-CAR - CONTINUOUS

Adam sits motionless. Staring straight ahead.

His hands shake. There's blood under his fingernails. On his shirt.

In the back: a shipping box. Looking completely ordinary.

Containing a body wrapped in rope.

And a severed hand.

Adam, whisper.

                    ADAM
          He's getting worse.

The sirens fade behind them. The plaza recedes into the distance.

Adam closes his eyes.

Adam (cont'd), quiet.

                    ADAM (CONT'D)
          This can't continue. This can't...

But it will.

He knows it will.

Because he's trapped. Because the money's too good. Because the alternative is going back to nothing.

Because he's already crossed every line there is.

The auto-car drives on through the night.

FADE TO BLACK.
