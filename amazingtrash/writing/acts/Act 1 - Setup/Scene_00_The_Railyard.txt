## Scene Heading
EXT. ABANDONED RAILYARD - HOMELESS ENCAMPMENT - DAY

## Characters
- ADAM (30s, homeless chemist, intelligent, isolated)
- Various homeless residents (background)

## Tone
Grounded, atmospheric, establishing

## Key Beats

1. OPENING: Wide establishing shot of abandoned railyard turned homeless encampment
   - Illegal structures built everywhere except on the tracks

   - Amazing Company infrastructure visible in distance (class contrast)

2. UNDERGROUND: Adam navigates secret passageways beneath settlement
   - Shows knowledge  of hidden infrastructure
   - Chemistry equipment glimpses in shadows
   - Moves like he owns these tunnels

3. THE SHIFT: Structure shifts above, causing vibrations underground
   - Adam scared by the movement
   - Something unstable about the settlement
   - Creates urgency to surface

4. AVOIDANCE: Adam emerges, goes to see sun, it is late afternoon
   - Actively avoids people
   - Isolated even within this community
   - Watches from distance - doesn't belong

5. CLOSING: Establish Adam as loner, intelligent, resourceful
   - Walks through tracktown to main city as darkness descends, world elements shown partly
   - Passes through food market in traincar structure but has no money
   - Goes through night police checkpoint to main city
   - auto-cars fill city streets and adam is walking on sidewalk alone
   - Alone by choice or circumstance?

## Visual Elements
- The sprawling railyard encampment
- Contrast: makeshift structures vs. Amazing Company towers in distance
- Hidden crawlspaces and tunnel network
- Adam's secretive movements
- Chemistry equipment in shadows
- Class divide visually established

## Dialogue Notes
- Minimal dialogue from Adam
- Overheard conversations establish world
- Adam observes, doesn't participate

## Purpose
- Introduce protagonist Adam
- Establish his world and isolation
- Show his intelligence and resourcefulness
- Set up the railyard location (important for later)
- Establish class divide of this dystopian world

## Story Position
- Opening scene of film
- Establishes "normal world" before inciting incident
- Shows what Adam has (survival) and lacks (connection)

## Transitions

## SCREENPLAY

EXT. ABANDONED RAILYARD - HOMELESS ENCAMPMENT - DAY

Wide shot: A sprawling abandoned railyard transformed into a makeshift city. Dozens of illegal structures - tents, tarps,
jury-rigged shacks - fill every available space between the train tracks. People move between structures, cooking fires
smoke, children run between the gaps.

The tracks themselves remain conspicuously empty and clear.

In the far distance, gleaming towers of the Amazing Company campus rise above the urban skyline. The contrast is stark -
polished corporate glass against rusted metal and canvas.

Push in through the encampment. HOMELESS RESIDENTS go about their routines - cooking, trading goods, repairing shelters.
Conversation and activity everywhere.

Near the center of the settlement, a low concrete structure half-buried in dirt. A maintenance hatch, almost hidden
behind stacked pallets and trash.

The hatch shifts slightly. Opens a crack.

ADAM (30s, weathered but sharp-eyed) peers out, checking if anyone's watching. His face shows intelligence worn down by
circumstance. He wears layers - practical, mismatched, forgettable.

Coast clear. Adam slips out, closing the hatch behind him. He moves with purpose but without drawing attention.

INT. UNDERGROUND TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS

Adam descends a rusted ladder into darkness. His movements are confident - he knows this place.

The tunnel is part of the old railyard infrastructure. Concrete walls marked with decades of water damage and graffiti.
Dim emergency lighting flickers, barely functional.

Adam walks through intersecting passages with certainty. No hesitation at forks or turns. This is his domain.

As he passes a recessed alcove, light glints off glass. A chemistry setup - beakers, tubing, heat sources - partially
hidden behind tarps and debris. Industrial-grade equipment, scavenged but meticulously arranged.

Adam doesn't stop. Just keeps walking.

The tunnel opens into a larger chamber. More evidence of habitation - a sleeping bag, stacked supplies, books and
notebooks. A home, hidden from the world above.

Adam grabs a small backpack from the floor, checks its contents. Satisfied, he slings it over his shoulder.

Above, a deep RUMBLING sound. The walls vibrate.

Adam freezes. Looks up.

The vibration intensifies. Dust falls from the ceiling. Something heavy is moving above - the entire structure of the
settlement shifting, settling.

A crack appears in the concrete above Adam's head. Small at first, then spreading.

Adam, under his breath.

                    ADAM
          Shit.

He moves quickly now, abandoning stealth for speed. Back through the tunnels, toward another exit point.

The rumbling continues, then stops as suddenly as it started.

Adam pauses at a different ladder, listening. Silence above. He climbs.

EXT. ABANDONED RAILYARD - LATE AFTERNOON - CONTINUOUS

Adam emerges from a different hatch, this one on the outskirts of the encampment. The sun is lower now, casting long
shadows.

He stays low, moving between structures without entering the main pathways. Avoiding eye contact, avoiding conversation.

A WOMAN calls out to someone nearby. Adam immediately shifts direction, putting a tent between himself and the voice.

He reaches the edge of the settlement where it borders the actual rail line. Stands there for a moment, facing the sun.

His expression softens slightly. This is the only moment of peace in his day.

Then voices approach from behind - residents passing by. Adam's face closes off. He turns and walks away, deeper into the
maze of structures.

EXT. TRANSITION AREA - DUSK TO NIGHT

A montage as darkness descends:

Adam walks from the railyard encampment toward the main city. The landscape changes gradually - industrial wasteland
giving way to developed areas.

He passes through a market built inside old train cars. Converted freight cars now house food vendors, clothing stalls,
electronics repair. People crowd the aisles.

Adam walks through alone, hands in pockets. His eyes track the food - fresh bread, cooked meat, vegetables. His stomach
may be empty but his face shows no emotion. He has no money. He doesn't stop.

The market vendors call out prices, haggle with customers. Adam is invisible to them.

EXT. CITY CHECKPOINT - NIGHT

A police checkpoint marks the boundary between the outer zone and the main city. Two OFFICERS stand beside a barrier,
checking IDs, waving people through or turning them back.

AUTO-CARS glide past on the city side of the checkpoint - sleek, silent, expensive. The contrast with the foot traffic on
this side is obvious.

Adam approaches the checkpoint. One officer barely glances at him before waving him through. He's unremarkable enough not
to register as a threat.

EXT. MAIN CITY STREETS - NIGHT

Adam walks on the sidewalk. AUTO-CARS fill the streets - no human drivers, no variation in speed or spacing. Perfect
efficiency.

The buildings here are taller, cleaner. Digital advertisements glow from screens. Everything is lit, controlled,
monitored.

Adam walks alone on the sidewalk. Occasionally another pedestrian passes, but most people are in the cars.

He is isolated even here, in the heart of the city.

Wide shot: Adam, a single figure on foot, surrounded by the endless flow of autonomous vehicles. Small and alone against
the mechanical city.

FADE TO BLACK.
