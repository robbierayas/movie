# SCENE 4 - THE DISPOSAL

## Scene Heading
INT. RAILYARD - SECRET CHAMBER - NIGHT

## Characters
- ADAM
- BODY (being disposed)

## Tone
Grim, procedural, revealing

## Key Beats

1. THE JOURNEY: Adam drags body through secret passageways
   - Returns to railyard
   - Navigates hidden tunnels beneath settlement
   - Complex route - knows it by heart
   - Avoids detection from community above

2. THE CHAMBER: Hidden room filled with glowing acidic waste
   - Secret chamber Adam has prepared
   - Large vat/pool of glowing acid
   - Eerie, chemical glow lighting the space
   - This is his solution

3. THE LAB: Scattered equipment reveals more
   - Chemistry equipment everywhere
   - Beakers, tubes, compounds
   - Well-stocked lab setup
   - Connected to his makeshift workspace
   - This is where he's been living his "other life"

4. THE PROCESS: Adam dissolves the body
   - Methodical, scientific approach
   - Lowers body into acid
   - Watches it dissolve
   - Takes notes (habit? or tracking?)
   - Destroys all evidence completely

5. THE EXPERTISE: Shows his chemistry knowledge
   - Knows exactly what he's doing
   - This isn't improvised - he planned this
   - Professional level knowledge
   - Careful, precise movements

6. THE RETURN: Back to surface
   - Cleans up thoroughly
   - Returns through tunnels
   - Carefully hides the entrance
   - Emerges near his sleeping spot

7. THE CONTRAST: Sleeps on ground despite having lab
   - Still homeless
   - Despite sophisticated lab below
   - The irony: genius chemist living in poverty
   - Lab is secret, survival is public

## Visual Elements
- The glowing acidic waste (eerie, dangerous)
- Secret tunnel network
- Chemistry equipment and lab setup
- Adam's methodical process
- Body dissolving (handled tastefully/horrifically)
- Contrast: sophisticated lab vs. sleeping on ground
- Chemical reactions, smoke/steam

## Dialogue Notes
- Minimal dialogue (Adam alone)
- Possible internal monologue/muttering
- Scientific terminology as he works
- Establishes Adam's voice when alone

## Purpose
- Show Adam's capability and expertise
- Establish the disposal method for the film
- Reveal his hidden resources and lab
- Character depth: homeless but genius chemist
- Visual contrast of his two lives
- Prove to Geoff (and audience) he can do this

## Story Position
- Completes first disposal job
- Establishes method for future jobs
- Reveals Adam's secret world
- Proves his value to Geoff

## Transitions
- IN: From Scene 3 (police stop, continues to railyard)
- OUT: Job complete → must collect payment (Scene 5)

## SCREENPLAY

EXT. RAILYARD - EDGE OF SETTLEMENT - NIGHT

The auto-car stops at the periphery of the railyard settlement. Silent. Clean. Completely out of place.

The door opens. Adam emerges, looking around nervously. He pops the cargo area, pulls out the wrapped bundle.

The weight is awkward. He struggles briefly, then gets a better grip. Drags it into the shadows between makeshift
structures.

The auto-car's door closes. The vehicle glides away silently, disappearing into the night.

Adam watches it go, then turns toward the settlement with his terrible burden.

INT. RAILYARD TUNNELS - NIGHT

Adam descends through the maintenance hatch we saw in Scene 0. The wrapped body drags behind him, bumping down metal
rungs.

The tunnels are dark except for flickering emergency lights. He navigates by memory, moving with certainty despite the
poor visibility.

Takes a left turn. Then a right. Another left. The path is complex, deliberately so. Nobody would stumble on this route
by accident.

He passes his sleeping chamber. Doesn't stop. Goes deeper.

Another hatch - this one lower, more concealed. Almost invisible if you don't know it's there.

Adam opens it. A ladder descends into complete darkness.

He pushes the body through first. It tumbles down with a heavy THUD.

Then he climbs down after it.

INT. SECRET CHAMBER - NIGHT

Adam's feet hit solid ground. He reaches up, pulls the hatch closed above him. Complete darkness.

A click. A switch.

LIGHT.

Chemical glow - green and eerie. The chamber is larger than expected. Ten by fifteen feet. Low concrete ceiling.

Against the far wall: a large industrial vat, maybe four feet deep. The liquid inside glows sickly green, viscous and
bubbling slightly. Acid.

Around the chamber: chemistry equipment. Beakers, burners, tubes coiled like intestines. Bottles of chemicals on shelves.
A proper lab, hidden underground.

This is no improvised solution. This is planned. Prepared. Professional.

Adam looks at the body on the floor. Takes a breath.

Adam, quiet, to the body.

                    ADAM
          I'm sorry. I don't know who you were.

He crouches, begins unwrapping the plastic. The victim's face is visible now - peaceful in death, but still a person who
had a life.

Adam closes his eyes for a moment. Then opens them.

Adam (cont'd) turns to himself.

                    ADAM (CONT'D)
          Do the work. Just do the work.

He grabs a pair of heavy rubber gloves from a shelf. Puts them on. The gloves go up to his elbows.

Then a face shield. Safety equipment. He's done this before - or at least planned for it.

Adam drags the body to the edge of the vat. The acid bubbles, hungry.

He lifts the body - struggling with the weight - and rolls it into the vat.

SPLASH.

The liquid surges over the edges, splashing onto the concrete floor. Adam steps back, avoiding it.

The body begins to dissolve immediately. Skin bubbling, tissue breaking down. The chemical reaction is violent,
efficient.

Adam watches for a moment, then turns away. Walks to a small desk in the corner - more makeshift workspace.

A notebook sits there. He opens it. Pages of notes, calculations, chemical formulas. This is serious work.

He adds a new entry:

"Subject disposed successfully. Time to full dissolution: estimated 6-8 hours. Acid pH levels stable. No complications."

He pauses, pen hovering over paper. Then adds:

"First job complete. God help me."

Adam sets the pen down. Looks at the vat. The body is barely visible now, already broken down to organic sludge.

His expression is hollow. This is what he is now. This is what he does.

He moves to another shelf, begins checking chemical levels in various containers. Routine maintenance. Making sure the
next disposal will go just as smoothly.

Because there will be a next disposal. He knows it.

TIME CUT:

Hours pass. Adam works methodically. Testing pH levels. Adjusting the mixture. Disposing of the plastic wrapping in a
separate chemical bath.

Cleaning every surface.

The body is completely gone now. Nothing but glowing liquid in the vat. No evidence. No trace.

Adam pulls off the gloves. The face shield. Sets them aside for cleaning.

He looks at the chamber - his hidden laboratory, his terrible secret.

Adam, whisper.

                    ADAM
          What am I becoming?

No answer. Just the quiet bubble of acid dissolving reality.

INT. RAILYARD TUNNELS - NIGHT

Adam climbs back through the hatch. Seals it behind him. Retraces his steps through the maze of passages.

Emerges in his sleeping chamber. The contrast is stark - the sophisticated lab below, this bare-bones survival space
above.

He has a sleeping bag. Some clothes. Books. Basic supplies.

Despite having access to all that chemistry equipment, all that knowledge - he sleeps on the floor like everyone else in
the settlement.

Adam pulls Geoff's business card from his pocket. Stares at it.

The job is done. Now he has to collect payment.

EXT. RAILYARD - ADAM'S SLEEPING SPOT - DAWN

The first light of morning seeps through gaps in the structure above. Adam lies on his sleeping bag, staring at nothing.

He hasn't slept. Can't sleep.

His hands are clean but he keeps looking at them anyway. Seeing phantom stains that aren't there.

Around him, the settlement begins to wake up. Voices. Movement. Normal life resuming.

But Adam's life isn't normal anymore.

He sits up. Grabs the business card again. Makes a decision.

Time to face Geoff.

FADE TO BLACK.
