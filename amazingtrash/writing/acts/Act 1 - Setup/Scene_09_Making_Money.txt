## SCREENPLAY

EXT. RAILYARD - ENCAMPMENT - DAY

The same railyard from Scene 0, but transformed. More vibrant. More alive.

People move between structures with purpose. A vegetable garden grows in soil-filled containers. Laundry hangs on lines.
Community thriving.

In the center: a barbecue made from a repurposed oil drum. Smoke rises. RESIDENTS gather around, cooking, talking,
laughing.

ADAM emerges from his tunnel entrance. Different now. Cleaner clothes - not new, but actually clean. Hair washed. He
carries grocery bags.

He looks at the gathering. Hesitates.

Then walks toward it.

AT THE BARBECUE:

A WOMAN (50s) tends the grill. A MAN (40s) cuts vegetables. Others sit on makeshift benches, plates in hand.

Adam approaches. Sets down the grocery bags.

Adam, awkward.

                    ADAM
          I brought... hamburger buns. And hot dogs. Thought maybe...

The Woman looks up. Smiles genuine warmth.

                    WOMAN
          Adam! That's perfect! Thank you!

She takes the bags. Other residents look up, surprised, pleased.

Man, grinning.

                    MAN
          Look at you, Mr. Generous! What'd you do, rob a bank?

Nervous laughter from Adam. Too close to the truth.

Adam, forced lightness.

                    ADAM
          Got lucky. Found some work.

JOE (40s, friendly face, talkative) appears beside Adam. He's the type who knows everyone and everything happening in the
community.

                    JOE
          Work? Really? That's great! What kind of work?

Adam, carefully.

                    ADAM
          Chemistry. Research stuff. Freelance.

Joe, impressed.

                    JOE
          Damn! Smart guy! I always said you looked like a scientist type. Didn't I say that, Marie?

The Woman (MARIE) nods, amused.

                    MARIE
          You said he looked "professory," yes.

                    JOE
          See! I can spot talent!
          (to Adam)
          Haven't seen you around much lately. Figured you were busy. But this is good! Real good!

Adam nods, still awkward but warming up.

A YOUNG WOMAN passes by carrying broken shelter materials. Adam sees her struggling.

Adam, without thinking.

                    ADAM
          Need help?

She stops, surprised.

                    YOUNG WOMAN
          Yeah, actually. If you don't mind?

                    ADAM
          Sure.

He takes half the load. They walk toward her shelter. Joe watches, pleased.

Joe turns to Marie, quiet.

                    JOE
          He's coming out of his shell. Good to see.

TIME CUT:

Adam helps repair the young woman's shelter. Hands her tools. Holds pieces while she secures them. Working together.

Others notice. The community watches Adam integrate.

LATER - AT THE BARBECUE:

Adam sits on a bench, plate of food in hand. People around him, talking, eating. He's part of the circle now, not
hovering at the edges.

Joe sits beside him.

                    JOE
          You know, we look out for each other here. That's what makes this place work. Everyone contributes what they
          can.

Adam, quiet.

                    ADAM
          Yeah. I'm learning that.

                    JOE
          You're doing good. People notice. Marie was saying just yesterday how much nicer things have been since you
          started helping out.

Adam looks around. At the community. The people who were strangers in Scene 0 are faces now. Names. Connections.

Adam smiles.

                    ADAM
          It feels good. Helping.

Joe, patting his shoulder.

                    JOE
          That's the spirit.

A MAN across the circle calls out:

MAN 2
Hey Adam, you going anywhere near the store later?

Adam looks up.

                    ADAM
          I could. Need something?

MAN 2
If you're going anyway, could you grab milk? I'll pay you back tomorrow.

Adam, standing.

                    ADAM
          Don't worry about it. Anyone else need anything?

A few voices call out requests. Adam pulls out his phone, making a list. People smile, grateful.

Joe, grinning.

                    JOE
          Look at you! Community quarterback!

Adam laughs. Genuine. The sound surprises him.

When was the last time he laughed?

Adam turns to the group.

                    ADAM
          Okay, milk, bread, eggs, coffee. I'll be back in an hour.

                    MARIE
          Thank you, Adam. Really.

He nods. Grabs his jacket.

As he walks toward the exit, he passes his tunnel entrance. Thinks about what's hidden below - the acid vat, the
chemistry equipment, the notebook full of disposal notes.

Blood money paying for these groceries.

Blood money buying community acceptance.

Blood money making him visible, valued, part of something.

He pushes the thought away.

Right now, in this moment, he's helping people. That's what matters.

Right?

FADE TO BLACK.
