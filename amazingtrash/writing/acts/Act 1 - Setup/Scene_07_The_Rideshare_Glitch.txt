## SCREENPLAY

EXT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

Adam drags the wrapped body to the curb. Sets it down carefully. The body slumps against him like a drunk friend.

He pulls out his phone. Opens the Amazing Company transport app.

Selects: "PRIVATE TRANSPORT - DISPOSAL SITE"

The screen loads. Then:

"SEARCHING FOR AVAILABLE VEHICLE..."

Adam waits, supporting the body's weight.

"RIDE ASSIGNED - ARRIVING IN 2 MINUTES"

An auto-car approaches. Sleek, clean. Stops in front of Adam.

Adam starts to load the body into the back seat --

The car display lights up: "RIDESHARE POOL ACTIVE"

Adam freezes.

Adam, whisper.

                    ADAM
          No. No no no...

He checks his phone. The app shows: "RIDESHARE POOL - SAVE 40%"

It defaulted to pool mode. He didn't catch it.

Adam (cont'd), desperately tapping phone.

                    ADAM (CONT'D)
          Cancel. Cancel!

But the body's already in the car. And another passenger icon appears on the app map - approaching fast.

Too late.

Adam gets in beside the body. Door closes automatically.

INT. AUTO-CAR (RIDESHARE POOL) - NIGHT

Adam sits rigid. The body slumps against him, head lolling forward. The wrapping makes it look like a person in bulky
clothes.

The car display shows: "PICKING UP PASSENGER 2 - MARCUS K."

Adam turns to himself.

                    ADAM
          Oh god. Oh god.

EXT. STREET CORNER - NIGHT

The auto-car pulls up to a corner. Door opens.

Marcus (30s, standard class, tired from work, friendly face) gets in without really looking.

Marcus, sighing with relief.

                    MARCUS
          Man, long day...

He sits down. Realizes how cramped it is - three across in the back.

Marcus (cont'd) turns to Adam.

                    MARCUS (CONT'D)
          Hey. Sorry about the pool thing. Trying to save a few bucks, you know?

Adam, terse.

                    ADAM
          Yeah. It's fine.

Marcus settles in. Glances at the body on Adam's other side.

                    MARCUS
          Your friend okay?

Adam, quickly.

                    ADAM
          Yeah. He's fine. Just... tired.

Marcus, sympathetic.

                    MARCUS
          Rough night?

Adam laughs.

                    ADAM
          You have no idea.

The car starts moving. Adam stares straight ahead, willing this ride to end.

Marcus tries to make small talk.

                    MARCUS
          I hate these pool rides but the prices, man. Everything's so expensive now. You work around here?

Adam, short.

                    ADAM
          Kind of.

                    MARCUS
          What do you do?

Adam, panicking internally.

                    ADAM
          ...Chemistry. Research.

Marcus, impressed.

                    MARCUS
          Oh nice! Smart guy. Me, I'm in logistics. Not as cool.
          (chuckles)

The car turns a corner. The body shifts, head lolling to the side unnaturally.

Marcus notices. His smile fades.

                    MARCUS (CONT'D)
          Whoa... his head moved weird. Is he okay?

Adam, too fast.

                    ADAM
          Yes! He's fine. Just drunk.

Marcus, concerned.

                    MARCUS
          Dude, I thought he was dead for a second. That movement was...
          (trails off)

Silence. Marcus stares at the body. Something's off.

                    MARCUS (CONT'D)
          Hey man, you sure he's alright? Maybe we should --

Marcus reaches toward the body. Adam's heart stops.

Adam, intercepting.

                    ADAM
          Wait! I'll check!

Adam grabs the body's neck, fumbling for where a pulse would be. His hands shake.

Marcus watches, suspicious now.

Adam (cont'd), forcing calm.

                    ADAM (CONT'D)
          Yeah. Yeah he's got a pulse. See? He's fine.

Marcus doesn't look convinced.

Marcus, uncertain.

                    MARCUS
          If you say so...

The car turns again. The body slips lower. Adam tries to adjust it, pulling the knees forward to prop it up.

The movement makes the head shift back --

SMACK.

The head hits the seat rest hard. Unmistakably the sound of dead weight.

Adam and Marcus both freeze.

Silence.

Then Adam makes a sound - a snoring sound. Loud, exaggerated.

SNOOOOORRRE.

Marcus looks at Adam. Adam gestures toward the body.

Adam laughs.

                    ADAM
          See? Just sleeping it off!

He forces another laugh. It sounds hysterical.

Adam (cont'd) laughs.

                    ADAM (CONT'D)
          He always snores like that when he's drunk!

Marcus stares. Then - slowly - starts to laugh too. Uncertain, but willing to believe because the alternative is too
strange.

Marcus laughs.

                    MARCUS
          Damn... he sounds rough.

Adam laughs.

                    ADAM
          Yeah! Rough night!

They both laugh. The sound fills the small car. Absurd. Wrong.

The laughter dies out. Awkward silence.

Marcus shifts uncomfortably. Keeps glancing at the body.

Marcus, quieter.

                    MARCUS
          Your friend sounds... really bad, actually. Maybe you should take him to urgent care?

Adam sees the out. Grabs it.

Adam, suddenly concerned.

                    ADAM
          You know what? You're right. He does sound bad.

Adam pulls out his phone. Changes the destination.

Adam (cont'd) turns to car.

                    ADAM (CONT'D)
          Change destination to... Mercy Urgent Care.

Car voice, automated.

                    CAR VOICE
          Destination updated. Passenger 2 drop-off in three minutes.

Marcus nods, relieved to have helped. But also clearly wanting out of this car.

The rest of the ride is silent. Marcus stares out the window. Adam holds the body upright, trying to keep it from moving.

Every second feels like an hour.

EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - NIGHT

The car pulls up to Marcus's stop. The door opens before the car fully stops.

Marcus, getting out quickly.

                    MARCUS
          This is me. Good luck with your friend, man. Hope he's okay.

He practically runs from the car. Looks back once, nervous.

The door closes. Car drives on.

INT. AUTO-CAR - CONTINUOUS

Adam alone with the body.

He exhales. A long, shuddering breath he's been holding for minutes.

Adam, whisper.

                    ADAM
          Oh my god. Oh my god.

He pulls out his phone. Hands shaking. Changes the destination back to the disposal site.

                    CAR VOICE
          Destination updated. Arrival in fifteen minutes.

Adam looks at the body slumped next to him. At the seat where Marcus was sitting.

At how close that was.

He starts laughing. Can't help it. Nervous, terrified laughter.

Adam laughs.

                    ADAM
          A snore. I made a snoring sound. At a corpse.

The absurdity crashes down. The horror underneath the comedy.

He stops laughing. Just sits there.

The city passes by outside. The car drives itself to the disposal site.

Adam stares at nothing, the body beside him.

Another close call.

Another line crossed.

FADE TO BLACK.
