Wordless scene. Adam arrives at the Amazing Company shipping facility carrying a sealed box. No dialogue, no explanation. Just the act of sending the preserved body to the news.

### Key Beats
1. **Arrival** - Adam walks up to shipping facility carrying an Amazing Company box
2. **Drop-Off** - Places box on automated drop-off station
3. **Processing** - Scans label, enters information on touchscreen
4. **Gone** - Box accepted by conveyor belt, disappears into facility
5. **No Turning Back** - Adam watches it go

### Character Moments
- **Adam**: Silent, focused. This is the point of no return. The evidence is out of his hands now. Brief pause after the box disappears - realization of what he's done.

### Closing
Box vanishes into the sorting system. Adam stands there a moment, then turns and walks away. The plan is in motion.
