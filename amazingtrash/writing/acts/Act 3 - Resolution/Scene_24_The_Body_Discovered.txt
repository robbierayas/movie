# Scene 24 - The Body Discovered

## LOCATION
INT. AMAZING COMPANY HEADQUARTERS / EXT. PRESS CONFERENCE - AFTERNOON

## CHARACTERS
Geoff, Moosk, PR Handler, Reporters, Adam (watching on TV)

## SCENE LAYOUT

### Opening
Thursday afternoon. Geoff is preparing to make a public statement about a body that was discovered in an Amazing Company shipping box. He's getting ready to go out, mentions he has to get to the charity event afterward. He's briefed quickly (or finds out details as he's making the statement). Geoff is confident he can spin this. After all, he's untouchable.

### Key Beats
1. **Getting Ready** - Geoff preparing for press conference. Mentions needing to get to the charity event tonight. Quick briefing about the body discovery.
2. **The Press Conference** - Geoff stands in front of Amazing Company HQ with press. Cameras everywhere. Reads prepared statement: shocked by discovery, cooperating fully with police, no knowledge of victim's identity or how body ended up in company box.
3. **The Performance** - Geoff plays the role perfectly. Concerned billionaire. Philanthropist horrified by tragedy. "We take worker safety and security protocols very seriously." Promises internal investigation.
4. **The Questions** - Reporters ask about the anonymous note. Geoff dismisses it: "Anyone can write a note. Doesn't make it true." Asked if he knew the victim. "Police haven't even identified the body yet. How could I?"
5. **The Mask Slips** - After press conference, cameras off, Geoff returns to his car with Moosk. The philanthropist act drops immediately. Titter laugh: "Heh-heh-heh. They bought it." Tells Moosk to keep watching Adam. Geoff is confident and amused - "This is going to be fun."

### Character Moments
- **Geoff**: Confident and controlled during press conference. Plays the philanthropist role flawlessly - concerned,
cooperative, confused. But the moment cameras turn off, the mask drops completely. The titter laugh reveals his true
contempt. He's not worried - just annoyed someone is trying to damage his reputation. Underestimates what Adam has
planned.
- **Moosk**: Silent enforcer. Scans the press conference crowd for threats. When Geoff orders him to find who sent the
package, immediately begins analysis. Efficient. Emotionless.
- **PR Handler**: Knows Geoff is guilty but doesn't care. Job is to protect his reputation, not seek truth. Crafts the
narrative expertly.

### Closing
Geoff in the car with Moosk, laughing. The press conference was a success. He's confident and amused by Adam's attempt to expose him. Orders Moosk to keep watching Adam but doesn't see him as a real threat - just entertainment. Tomorrow's charity event will rehabilitate his image completely. He has no idea what's waiting for him.

## FULL SCRIPT

INT. AMAZING COMPANY HEADQUARTERS - GEOFF'S OFFICE - AFTERNOON

Thursday afternoon.

Geoff adjusts his tie in a mirror. Getting ready.

His PR HANDLER (40s, woman, sharp) stands nearby with notes.

                    PR HANDLER
          The news broke two hours ago. Body found in one of our shipping boxes. Police are investigating.

                    GEOFF
          Whose body?

                    PR HANDLER
          Unidentified. Male, fifties. Preserved with chemicals. There was an anonymous note claiming it was one of your
          victims.

Geoff, calmly.

                    GEOFF
          How dramatic.

                    PR HANDLER
          The press is demanding a response. I've set up a conference in fifteen minutes.

                    GEOFF
          And after that, I have the charity gala tonight?

                    PR HANDLER
          Yes. Seven PM. This couldn't have come at a worse time.

                    GEOFF
          Or a better one. A public appearance right after this will show I have nothing to hide.

He turns to her.

                    GEOFF (CONT'D)
          What's my line?

                    PR HANDLER
          Shocked. Horrified. Cooperating fully with authorities. Emphasize worker safety and security protocols.

                    GEOFF
          Easy enough.

                    PR HANDLER
          Don't mention the note specifically. If asked, dismiss it as unverified claims. Anyone can write anything.

                    GEOFF
          The police will identify him eventually.

                    PR HANDLER
          By then, you've already established the narrative: you had nothing to do with this. Someone's trying to frame
          you.

                    GEOFF
          And they'll believe that?

                    PR HANDLER
          You're a billionaire philanthropist. You've donated millions to charity. You employ thousands of people. Why
          would you risk all that to murder a random person?

                    GEOFF
          Why indeed.

                    PR HANDLER
          Stick to the script. Express concern. Promise cooperation. Don't get defensive. Don't engage with conspiracy
          theories.

She hands him a printed statement.

                    PR HANDLER (CONT'D)
          Read this. Word for word. Then take three questions maximum and exit.

Geoff scans the statement.

                    GEOFF
          "Deeply disturbed..." "Full cooperation..." "Thoughts and prayers..."

He looks up.

                    GEOFF (CONT'D)
          Perfect.

EXT. AMAZING COMPANY HEADQUARTERS - PRESS CONFERENCE - AFTERNOON

3:00 PM.

A podium set up in front of the building.

REPORTERS and CAMERAS crowd the area.

Geoff approaches the podium. Moosk behind him, just offscreen.

He looks somber. Concerned.

Clears his throat.

                    GEOFF
          Thank you all for coming. I'll read a brief statement, then take a few questions.

He unfolds the paper.

                    GEOFF (CONT'D)
          This morning, I learned of a deeply disturbing discovery involving an Amazing Company shipping container. A
          body was found inside a package delivered to Channel 7 News. I want to be absolutely clear: I have no knowledge
          of how this happened, who the victim is, or who sent this package.

Cameras flash.

                    GEOFF (CONT'D)
          Amazing Company takes the safety and security of our shipping operations very seriously. We are cooperating
          fully with law enforcement to investigate this incident. Our thoughts and prayers are with the victim's family,
          whoever they may be.

He folds the paper.

                    GEOFF (CONT'D)
          I'll take a few questions.

Hands shoot up.

                    GEOFF (CONT'D)
          Yes?

REPORTER 1
Mr. Geoffrey, the anonymous note claims you're responsible for this person's death. How do you respond?

                    GEOFF
          Anyone can write a note. That doesn't make it true. I have no idea who sent that package or why they're making
          these baseless accusations.

REPORTER 2
Have you been contacted by police?

                    GEOFF
          Yes. I've offered our full cooperation. We've provided access to our shipping records and security footage.

REPORTER 3
Do you know who the victim is?

                    GEOFF
          No. Police haven't released an identification yet. I'm as eager as anyone to learn the truth.

REPORTER 1
Some are calling this a cover-up. What do you say to that?

                    GEOFF
          I say that's irresponsible speculation. A tragedy has occurred, and we need to let law enforcement do their
          job. Jumping to conclusions helps no one.

He steps back from the podium.

                    GEOFF (CONT'D)
          That's all for now. Thank you.

He turns and walks back into the building.

Moosk follows.

Reporters shout more questions.

He ignores them.

INT. AMAZING COMPANY AUTO-CAR - AFTERNOON

Geoff sits in the back seat. Moosk beside him.

The car pulls away from the headquarters.

The moment they're out of sight, Geoff's somber expression vanishes.

He laughs.

                    GEOFF
          Heh-heh-heh. HEH-HEH-HEH.

                    MOOSK
          Analysis: Press conference successful. Narrative control established.

                    GEOFF
          They bought every word. "Thoughts and prayers." Heh-heh-heh.

                    MOOSK
          Threat assessment update: Adam remains active threat.

                    GEOFF
          Of course he does. He sent the body. He's planning something else.

                    MOOSK
          Recommendation: Terminate Adam before Friday charity event.

                    GEOFF
          No. I want to see what he does next. This is... entertaining.

                    MOOSK
          Risk level increasing.

                    GEOFF
          I can handle it. Besides, security at the charity event will be airtight. Adam can't get within a hundred feet
          of me.

                    MOOSK
          Acknowledged. Monitoring Adam's location.

                    GEOFF
          Where is he now?

                    MOOSK
          Tracktown. No suspicious activity detected.

                    GEOFF
          Keep watching. If he makes a move, I want to know immediately.

                    MOOSK
          Affirmative.

Geoff leans back.

Looks out the window.

                    GEOFF
          Adam. Adam, Adam, Adam. You really think you can beat me?

He laughs again.

                    GEOFF (CONT'D)
          This is going to be fun.

FADE OUT.
