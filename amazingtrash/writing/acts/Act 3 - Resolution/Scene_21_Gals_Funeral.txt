# Scene 21 - Gal's Funeral

## LOCATION
EXT. RAILYARD - TRACKTOWN - DAY

## CHARACTERS
Adam, Tyson, Joe, Marie, Tracktown Residents (approximately 30 people)

## SCENE LAYOUT

### Opening
Two days after Gal's death. Marie has arranged a funeral in Tracktown - simple but dignified. The community gathers around a makeshift memorial. Tyson told Joe everything offscreen, and the truth has spread through Tracktown like wildfire: Gal was murdered by a billionaire named Geoff because Adam tried to quit working for him. Now the community knows Adam's been forced to dispose of bodies for months, threatened into silence. The funeral becomes more than mourning - it becomes a rallying cry.

### Key Beats
1. **The Gathering** - Community members arrive, paying respects. Some bring flowers, candles, small tokens. Gal's body is in a simple casket (or wrapped respectfully if no casket).
2. **Marie's Words** - Marie speaks first, talking about Gal as a person - her dreams, her hope to escape Tracktown, her kindness.
3. **Tyson's Testimony** - Tyson speaks about what happened. Doesn't hold back. Says Geoff killed her. Says Adam was forced to work for him. The community listens, shocked but believing.
4. **The Ripple** - Joe steps forward, says he'll help Adam get justice. Then another person. Then another. One by one, people pledge support.
5. **Community Pledge** - "We'll help you take him down." "Whatever you need." "For Gal." The funeral transforms into a planning session.
6. **Adam's Reaction** - Adam is overwhelmed. He expected isolation, condemnation. Instead, he has an army. Tracktown takes care of its own.
7. **The Burial/Farewell** - Final moment with Gal. Simple burial or cremation. Community solidarity.

### Character Moments
- **Adam**: Expected to be alone, cast out for bringing danger. Instead finds acceptance and support. Realizes he doesn't have to fight Geoff alone anymore. Emotional - this is what community means.
- **Tyson**: Takes the lead in rallying support. Young but determined. Tells the truth plainly. Becomes Adam's advocate when Adam can't speak for himself.
- **Joe**: First to pledge support. Practical and strategic. "What do you need?" attitude. Represents the Tracktown ethos of collective action.
- **Marie**: Organizer. Brings the community together. Maternal figure. Makes sure Gal is honored properly.
- **Tracktown Residents**: Diverse responses but unified in support. Some angry, some grieving, all determined. They've been stepped on by the system too long - here's a chance to fight back.

### Closing
After the funeral, the community disperses with quiet purpose - united and ready to act. Adam stands at Gal's grave, no longer isolated. The detailed exposure plan (preserved body evidence, production feed takeover, obtaining bodycam footage, coordination) is worked out offscreen by Adam, Tyson, and Joe with community support. The scene ends on solidarity - Tracktown has rallied, and Geoff has no idea what's coming.

## FULL SCRIPT

EXT. RAILYARD - TRACKTOWN - DAY

Overcast sky. Grey light.

A crowd of THIRTY PEOPLE gathers in a cleared area of Tracktown.

In the center: a simple CASKET. Wooden. Plain. Dignified.

Around it: CANDLES, FLOWERS, small tokens left by residents.

ADAM stands to one side, apart from the crowd. Hollow. Exhausted.

TYSON stands near the front with JOE and MARIE.

Marie steps forward. Older woman, weathered, kind eyes.

                    MARIE
          Most of you knew Gal. Some of you only saw her around. But all of us knew she was one of us.

People nod. Murmurs of agreement.

                    MARIE (CONT'D)
          She wanted out of here. Not because she hated Tracktown - but because she had dreams. Big dreams. She wanted to
          see the world. Build something. Be someone.

Marie's voice cracks slightly.

                    MARIE (CONT'D)
          She never got that chance. And that's not fair. It's not right.

She steps back.

Tyson steps forward.

Young. Grief-stricken. But determined.

                    TYSON
          Gal was killed two nights ago. Murdered.

The crowd stirs. Whispers.

                    TYSON (CONT'D)
          By a man named Geoff. A billionaire. He owns the Amazing Company.

More whispers. Some people recognize the name.

                    TYSON (CONT'D)
          He killed her because Adam tried to quit working for him.

All eyes turn to Adam.

Adam looks down. Can't meet their gaze.

                    TYSON (CONT'D)
          For months, Geoff's been forcing Adam to dispose of bodies. Murder victims. People Geoff killed. Adam didn't have
          a choice - Geoff threatened all of us. Everyone in Tracktown.

Shocked silence.

                    TYSON (CONT'D)
          Adam tried to quit. Tried to poison Geoff. It didn't work. And Geoff... he made an example. Sent his robot to kill
          Gal. To show Adam what happens if he doesn't obey.

A woman in the crowd speaks up.

                    WOMAN
          Why didn't he go to the police?

Tyson, bitterly.

                    TYSON
          Geoff owns the police. Some of them, anyway. Enough.

Joe steps forward.

                    JOE
          I helped Adam carry a body once. Didn't know what it was at the time. But I saw cops on Geoff's payroll. Saw them
          look the other way. Tyson's telling the truth.

The crowd processes this.

Another RESIDENT speaks - middle-aged man, skeptical.

                    RESIDENT
          So what do we do about it?

                    TYSON
          Adam has a plan. Evidence. A way to expose Geoff publicly. But it's dangerous.

Joe steps beside Tyson.

                    JOE
          Then we help him.

Adam looks up, surprised.

                    ADAM
          Joe--

                    JOE
          Gal was one of ours. And you're one of ours. This billionaire thinks he can roll into Tracktown and take what he
          wants? Hell no.

A younger woman steps forward.

                    YOUNG WOMAN
          I'll help. Whatever you need.

An older man.

                    OLDER MAN
          Me too. For Gal.

One by one, people step forward.

                    ANOTHER RESIDENT
          What's the plan?

Tyson looks at Adam.

Adam, hesitant.

                    ADAM
          I have a plan. To expose him publicly. Make it so he can't hide what he's done.

                    JOE
          Then we help you do it.

                    ADAM
          It's risky. He has security, surveillance--

                    YOUNG WOMAN
          I worked catering at big events. I can get people backstage.

                    ANOTHER MAN
          I know electronics. Cameras. Whatever you need.

                    OLDER MAN
          I'll help however I can.

Adam stares, overwhelmed.

People keep offering.

Skills. Resources. Time.

Marie, gently.

                    MARIE
          You're not alone, Adam. You never were.

Adam, breaking.

                    ADAM
          I brought this on her. On all of you. If I hadn't--

Tyson, cutting him off.

                    TYSON
          Geoff brought this on us. Not you. He's the one who kills people. You were just trying to survive.

                    JOE
          And now we fight back. Together.

The crowd murmurs agreement.

Adam looks around at the faces. Determined. Angry. Supportive.

His community.

Adam, quietly.

                    ADAM
          Okay.

                    JOE
          Okay?

                    ADAM
          Yeah. Let's do this.

Nods all around.

Marie steps forward again.

                    MARIE
          First, we say goodbye to Gal. Properly.

She gestures to the casket.

                    MARIE (CONT'D)
          Does anyone want to speak?

A few people step forward. Share memories:

- Gal helping someone find shelter
- Gal sharing food when she barely had any
- Gal laughing at a joke, lighting up the space
- Gal talking about her dreams with infectious hope

Adam listens. Each memory a knife.

She was so much more than he realized.

Finally, Tyson speaks one last time.

                    TYSON
          Gal wanted to leave Tracktown. She wanted better. And she would've made it, if she'd had the chance.

He looks at the crowd.

                    TYSON (CONT'D)
          Let's make sure her death means something. Let's make sure Geoff pays.

Voices rise in agreement.

"For Gal."
"We're with you."
"Let's take him down."
