## SCENE LAYOUT

### Opening
Wordless scene. Tyson, Joe, and the Tracktown team return to the encampment after escaping the convention center. No dialogue. Just the quiet aftermath.

### Key Beats
1. **Return** - Auto-car drops the team at Tracktown perimeter. They walk through the checkpoint.
2. **Dispersal** - Team members split off to their respective shelters. Exhausted. Silent.
3. **Tyson and Joe** - Remain together. Stand looking at the railyard.
4. **Waiting** - They wait for news. For Adam. For what comes next.

### Character Moments
- **Tyson**: Exhausted but awake. Can't sleep. Stares at the distance. Waiting.
- **Joe**: Sits with Tyson. Silent support. They exposed Geoff. Now they wait to see if it worked.
- **Tracktown Team**: Disperse quietly. No celebration. Just waiting.

### Closing
Tyson and Joe sit in silence. The railyard quiet around them. Waiting for morning. Waiting for news. Waiting for Adam.
