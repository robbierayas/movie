## SCENE LAYOUT

### Opening
Dawn. Geoff's auto-car pulls up outside Tracktown with Adam restrained inside. Moosk escorts Adam out. Geoff and Adam stand at the edge of the encampment - not inside. There is some conversation. Then the drones arrive. No choice. No countdown. Just gas. Immediate. Everyone dies within 11 seconds but onscreen the sequence takes longer showing gas spreading and people running.

### Key Beats
1. **Adam Brought to Tracktown** - Geoff's auto-car arrives at edge of encampment. Moosk escorts Adam out. Adam sees Tracktown in the distance. People waking up. Normal morning.
2. **The Conversation** - Geoff and Adam talk outside Tracktown. Geoff explains this is the consequence. Adam begs him to stop. Geoff is calm. No choice offered.
3. **Drones Arrive** - Drones fly in. Take positions over Tracktown. Residents look up, confused.
4. **Immediate Gassing** - Drones start releasing gas right away. No warning. No countdown. Hatches open and gas pours out.
5. **Panic** - People inside Tracktown realize what's happening. Try to run. Scream. Cover their faces. But gas spreads too fast.
6. **Deaths Begin** - People start collapsing. Within 11 seconds everyone is dead. But visually the sequence plays out longer - showing gas spreading, people running, screaming, falling.

### Character Moments
- **Adam**: Restrained outside Tracktown. Forced to watch. Begs Geoff to stop. When gas starts, screams at Geoff. Tries to run to help but Moosk holds him back. Watches everyone die.
- **Geoff**: Cold. This is policy, not rage. Explains to Adam why this is necessary. Watches with clinical detachment. "You defied me. There are consequences."
- **Moosk**: Silent enforcer. Holds Adam. Prevents him from interfering.
- **Tyson**: Inside Tracktown. Sees drones arrive. Realizes too late what's happening. Dies with everyone else.
- **Joe**: Dies trying to help people. Representative of the community.

### Closing
Gas fills Tracktown. People collapse. Screaming stops. Silence. Adam stares at the carnage. Geoff orders Moosk to release Adam. "Now you understand." Auto-car drives away, leaving Adam standing outside the dead encampment.

## FULL SCRIPT

EXT. RAILYARD - EDGE OF TRACKTOWN - DAWN

Grey light. Quiet morning.

An AMAZING COMPANY AUTO-CAR pulls up outside the perimeter of Tracktown.

Pristine. Black. Out of place against the poverty.

Door opens.

MOOSK steps out.

Reaches in and pulls out ADAM.

Hands zip-tied behind his back.

Bruised. Exhausted.

GEOFF steps out on the other side.

Straightens his jacket.

They stand at the edge of Tracktown - fifty feet from the nearest shelter.

Not inside. Just close enough to see.

Adam looks at the encampment.

People waking up. Starting fires. Normal morning routines.

Unaware.

                    ADAM
          Why did you bring me here?

                    GEOFF
          Because you need to understand consequences.

                    ADAM
          Geoff, please. Whatever you're planning--

                    GEOFF
          I'm not planning anything. I'm executing policy.

Adam stares at him.

                    ADAM
          Policy?

                    GEOFF
          You defied me. Attempted to destroy my reputation. Gathered evidence. Orchestrated a public attack.

                    ADAM
          Because you're a MURDERER!

                    GEOFF
          And you believed you could fight back. That you could win.

Beat.

                    GEOFF (CONT'D)
          I'm here to show you what happens to people who believe that.

                    ADAM
          These people had nothing to do with it!

                    GEOFF
          They sheltered you. Fed you. Some even helped you.

                    ADAM
          No. No, Geoff, please--

                    GEOFF
          You brought this on them. Not me. You.

Adam struggles against zip-ties.

                    ADAM
          PLEASE! I'll do anything! Just don't hurt them!

                    GEOFF
          There's nothing you can offer that I don't already have.

Geoff looks up.

Nods to Moosk.

Moosk taps his wrist device.

Then:

The sound.

WHIRRRRR.

Mechanical. Getting louder.

Adam looks up.

DRONES appear over the horizon.

Dozens of them.

Black. Sleek. Amazing Company logos.

Flying in formation toward Tracktown.

Adam, realizing.

                    ADAM
          No. No no no--

Inside Tracktown, residents hear the sound.

Look up.

TYSON sees the drones first.

                    TYSON
          What the hell are those?

JOE beside him.

                    JOE
          Drones?

The drones take positions over the encampment.

Hovering.

Forming a grid pattern.

Covering every section.

RESIDENT 1
Are those police?

RESIDENT 2
I don't think so.

Then:

HATCHES open on the drones' undersides.

CANISTERS visible inside.

WHIRRRR as mechanisms activate.

RESIDENT 3
What's--

The gas starts IMMEDIATELY.

No warning.

No countdown.

HISSING sounds as canisters release.

GREENISH GAS pours out of every drone.

Spreading.

Drifting down toward Tracktown.

Adam outside, screaming.

                    ADAM
          NO! STOP!

He tries to run toward the encampment.

Moosk grabs him.

Holds him in place.

                    ADAM (CONT'D)
          LET ME GO! THEY'RE GOING TO DIE!

                    GEOFF
          Yes. They are.

Inside Tracktown:

Tyson sees the gas coming.

                    TYSON
          RUN! EVERYONE RUN!

Chaos.

People scrambling.

Some try to reach exits but drones block the perimeter.

Gas spreading fast.

Everywhere.

JOE grabs cloth, covers his mouth.

                    JOE
          Don't breathe it!

But the gas is too thick.

Too fast.

RESIDENT 2 collapses first.

Gasping. Choking.

Then RESIDENT 3.

Then more.

People dropping.

Screaming.

Clawing at their throats.

Tyson running, trying to help someone.

But the gas gets him.

Falls to his knees.

Gasping.

Collapses.

Joe tries to drag an elderly woman to safety.

But there is no safety.

Gas everywhere.

Joe falls.

One by one, everyone drops.

Bodies collapsing.

Screaming.

Then silence.

Eleven seconds from gas release to last death.

But visually the sequence stretched longer - showing the gas spreading, people running, panic, death.

EXT. RAILYARD - EDGE OF TRACKTOWN - DAWN (CONTINUOUS)

Adam watches.

Restrained by Moosk.

Screaming.

                    ADAM
          NO! TYSON! JOE!

The gas dissipates slowly.

Drones hover over the silent encampment.

Bodies everywhere.

Eighty-four people.

All dead.

Adam stops struggling.

Stares.

Broken.

Geoff watches for a moment.

Then turns to Moosk.

                    GEOFF
          Release him.

Moosk releases Adam.

Adam doesn't move.

Just stares at the carnage.

Geoff, calmly.

                    GEOFF (CONT'D)
          Now you understand.

He walks back to the auto-car.

                    GEOFF (CONT'D)
          (to Moosk)
          We're done here.

Moosk follows.

They climb into the car.

Door closes.

Car drives away.

Leaving Adam standing alone.

Outside the dead encampment.

Staring at the bodies.

FADE TO:

**SCENE 28 - THE GASSING**

(Continuous)
