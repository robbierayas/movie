# Scene 28 - The Gassing (FINALE)

## LOCATION
EXT. RAILYARD - TRACKTOWN - DAWN

## CHARACTERS
Adam, Tracktown Residents (dying - 84 people)

## SCENE LAYOUT

### Opening
Continuous from Scene 27. Geoff's car has driven away. Adam stands alone at the edge of Tracktown. The gas has filled the encampment. People are dying. Graphic. Horrific. Screaming. Then silence. Adam turns away and leaves. Last shot: bodies on the ground, gas clearing. Movie ends before reanimation.

### Key Beats
1. **Graphic Deaths** - People dying from the gas. Choking. Gasping. Convulsing. Bodies collapsing. Show the horror.
2. **Screams Fade** - The screaming gradually stops. Silence falls over Tracktown.
3. **Adam Turns Away** - Once the screams stop, Adam can't watch anymore. Turns away. Starts walking.
4. **Adam Leaves** - Walks away from Tracktown. Doesn't look back. Broken. Alone.
5. **Final Shot** - Camera stays on Tracktown. Bodies on the ground. Gas clearing. Silence. Stillness.
6. **Question Remains** - Movie ends before any reanimation. The reanimation gas flaw is left as an unanswered question.

### Character Moments
- **Adam**: Forced to watch the deaths. When screams stop, something in him breaks. Turns away. Walks away. Leaving it all behind.
- **Tracktown Residents**: Die graphically. Painful. Horrific. The full weight of the massacre shown onscreen.

### Closing
Bodies lie motionless. Gas clears. Silence. Adam walks away in the distance. Movie ends on the stillness. The question of what comes next left unanswered.

## FULL SCRIPT

EXT. RAILYARD - TRACKTOWN - DAWN

Adam stands at the edge.

Geoff's car gone.

Just Adam and the dead.

Inside Tracktown:

Bodies everywhere.

Some still twitching.

Gasping final breaths.

RESIDENT 4, clawing at the ground.

Choking.

Face turning purple.

Goes still.

RESIDENT 5, curled in fetal position.

Convulsing.

Then motionless.

An ELDERLY WOMAN reaches out toward nothing.

Hand shaking.

Falls.

Dead.

A YOUNG MAN, barely twenty.

Gasping.

Eyes wide with terror.

Collapses against a shipping container.

Slides down.

Still.

The screaming fades.

One by one, the sounds of death stop.

Silence falls.

Adam watches it all.

Frozen.

Then:

He can't watch anymore.

Turns away.

Starts walking.

Away from Tracktown.

Away from the bodies.

Away from everything.

He doesn't look back.

Just walks.

Into the grey dawn.

Broken.

Alone.

EXT. RAILYARD - TRACKTOWN - DAWN (CONTINUOUS)

Camera stays on Tracktown.

Adam disappearing in the distance.

The encampment silent.

Bodies lie where they fell.

Eighty-four people.

The gas slowly clearing.

Drifting away on the morning breeze.

Leaving only the dead.

Silence.

Stillness.

The camera holds on the scene.

Bodies on the ground.

Gas dissipating.

No movement.

Just death.

FADE TO BLACK.

**THE END**

## Production Notes
- Graphic death sequence: choking, gasping, convulsing, painful
- Show the horror: faces turning colors, clawing, reaching, dying
- Individual deaths: focus on specific people to make it personal
- Silence falls: screams gradually stop, total quiet
- Adam turns away: can't watch anymore, walks away
- Adam leaving: walking into distance, broken, alone, doesn't look back
- Final shot: hold on Tracktown, bodies on ground, gas clearing
- No reanimation shown: movie ends before any bodies reanimate
- Reanimation left as question: what happens next is unknown
- No epilogue: no text, no explanation, just ends
- Tone: Brutal, final, hopeless
- Final image: stillness, death, silence

**THEMATIC CLOSURE:**
- The poor crushed by concentrated wealth
- No hope. No justice. Just death.
- Adam walks away with nothing
- System wins. Geoff wins.
- Movie ends on the horror - no resolution
