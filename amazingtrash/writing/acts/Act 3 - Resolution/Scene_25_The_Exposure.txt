## SCENE LAYOUT

### Opening
Friday night, 7:45 PM. The Amazing Company Charity Gala is in full swing. Hundreds of wealthy donors in the main hall.
Stage set with massive screens. Event coordinators broadcasting the gala. Geoff (actually his robot double, though
audience doesn't know yet) prepares backstage for his keynote speech about "ending poverty" and "helping the
disadvantaged." Meanwhile, Adam and the Tracktown team arrive at the back entrance with forged production crew passes.
This is it. Everything comes down to the next 15 minutes.

### Key Beats
1. **Arrival** - Adam, Tyson, Joe, and five Tracktown residents enter through back entrance. Security checks their passes
(forged but professional). They're in. Split up: Adam heads toward backstage, Tracktown team heads to production booth.
2. **Geoff's Speech Begins** - "Geoff" takes the stage at 8:00 PM. Event coordinators broadcasting. Hundreds in audience.
Speech about Amazing Company's commitment to ending homelessness, helping the poor, worker dignity. Crowd applauds.
3. **Taking the Booth** - Tracktown team reaches production booth. Small crew running the screens. Joe and team overpower
them quickly - no violence, just numbers. Lock the door from inside. Take control of the video feed system.
4. **Adam Backstage** - Adam navigates backstage, avoiding security. Moosk is with "Geoff" onstage, scanning the crowd.
Adam stays in blind spots, uses production crew chaos as cover. Reaches position near stage entrance.
5. **The Signal** - Adam texts Tyson: "Go." Tyson relays to production booth. They're ready.
6. **The Feed Takeover** - Mid-speech, the big screens cut away from Geoff's live feed. The Channel 7 news clip appears:
"Body Found in Amazing Company Shipping Container." Crowd murmurs.
7. **The Evidence** - Screens show in sequence:
   - News coverage of body discovery
   - Bodycam footage: Scene 14, Geoff forcing Adam to kiss corpse, police walking away, Geoff's titter laugh audible
   - Photos from Adam's documentation: broken bones, torture, disposal preparation
   - Final image: Preserved body from news story with label "Victim #1 of at least 15"
8. **The Reaction** - Crowd erupts. Gasps. Screams. People standing. Security confused. Geoff freezes onstage for a moment.
9. **Geoff's Response** - "Geoff" is completely unapologetic. Dismisses it as fake. Doesn't defend himself seriously.
Turns to leave the stage with Moosk.
10. **Adam's Attack** - As Geoff tries to leave, Adam rushes from backstage. Stabs robot Geoff with knife.
11. **Adam Kills Robot Geoff** - Adam successfully kills the robot. It collapses. Crowd screams.
12. **Hologram Geoff Appears** - A HOLOGRAM of Geoff appears above the stage. Smiles at Adam. "Nice one. Heh-heh-heh."
Just like the poison attempt in Scene 19. Hologram fades. Leaves Adam standing there, confused and defeated. Tyson and
Tracktown team escape production booth.

### Character Moments
- **Adam**: Calm and focused during the feed takeover. This is what Gal died for. When the evidence plays and Geoff tries
to leave unapologetically, Adam's rage takes over. Kills robot Geoff with knife. Then a hologram of Geoff appears and
laughs ("Nice one. Heh-heh-heh."), Adam realizes something is deeply wrong - he just killed a robot.
- **"Geoff" (Robot)**: Performs his speech flawlessly. When screens show evidence, barely reacts. Unapologetic. Dismisses
it casually. Tries to leave. When Adam attacks, doesn't defend itself. Gets stabbed and collapses. (Revealed to be robot
when hologram appears)
- **Real Geoff**: Watching remotely. Amused. This was expected. Let Adam have his moment. The real plan comes next.
- **Tyson**: Coordinates with Tracktown team in production booth. Watches the evidence play. This is for Gal. Escapes when
chaos erupts.
- **Joe**: Leads Tracktown team takeover of booth. Efficient and determined. Escapes with team.
- **Moosk**: Scans crowd continuously. Stands with robot Geoff but doesn't intervene when Adam attacks. Just observes.

### Closing
Adam kills robot Geoff. The robot collapses. Then a hologram of Geoff appears above the stage, laughing. "Nice one.
Heh-heh-heh." Just like the poison attempt. The hologram fades. Adam stands there, confused and defeated. He just killed a
robot. The exposure played - but it was never the real Geoff. Why the same "nice one" reaction? Tyson and Tracktown team
escape. Adam realizes something is terribly wrong. The answer comes in Scene 26.

## FULL SCRIPT

EXT. CONVENTION CENTER - BACK ENTRANCE - NIGHT

7:45 PM.

Adam, TYSON, JOE, and FIVE TRACKTOWN RESIDENTS approach the back entrance.

All wearing dark clothing. Serious expressions.

Adam hands out PRODUCTION CREW PASSES - professional, laminated, forged but convincing.

                    ADAM
          Everyone clear on the plan?

                    JOE
          We take the production booth. Control the video feed.

                    TYSON
          I stay with the team as relay.

                    ADAM
          And I get backstage. Once I give the signal, you play everything.

RESIDENT 1 (woman, 30s)
What if security stops us?

                    ADAM
          They won't. These passes are perfect. You're just replacement crew for the night shift.

RESIDENT 2 (man, 40s)
And after we play the footage?

                    ADAM
          You run. All of you. Don't wait for me. Just get out.

                    JOE
          What about you?

                    ADAM
          I'll be fine. This is my fight.

                    TYSON
          Our fight.

Adam looks at them. His team. His community.

                    ADAM
          Thank you. All of you.

                    JOE
          Let's go make some noise.

They approach the entrance.

TWO SECURITY GUARDS stand at the door.

SECURITY GUARD 1
IDs and passes.

They present their passes.

Guard 1 scans them with a reader.

Tense moment.

Then:

SECURITY GUARD 1 (CONT'D)
You're late. Crew call was 7:30.

                    ADAM
          Traffic. Won't happen again.

SECURITY GUARD 1
Get inside. Production booth is on level 2, section C.

They enter.

INT. CONVENTION CENTER - MAIN HALL - NIGHT

Massive space. Hundreds of WEALTHY DONORS in formal attire.

Stage at the front with ENORMOUS SCREENS on either side.

MEDIA CAMERAS positioned throughout.

MC/HOST (50s, polished) at podium.

                    MC
          ...and now, please welcome the founder and CEO of Amazing Company, a man whose philanthropic work has changed
          countless lives... Geoffrey!

Applause.

"GEOFF" (the robot double, indistinguishable from real Geoff) walks onstage.

Waves. Smiles. The philanthropist persona perfect.

Moosk follows, stands at stage edge. Red eyes scanning crowd.

"GEOFF"
Thank you. Thank you all for being here tonight.

Adam and the team watch from backstage corridor entrance.

Adam turns to team.

                    ADAM
          That's him. That's the target.

                    JOE
          Let's move.

---

INT. CONVENTION CENTER - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT

Adam separates from the team.

They head toward stairs marked "PRODUCTION LEVEL 2."

Adam stays backstage, moving through equipment, crew members rushing around.

He keeps his head down. Moves with purpose.

Stage is visible ahead. "Geoff" speaking.

"GEOFF" (O.S.)
At Amazing Company, we believe everyone deserves dignity. A chance. A future.

Adam's jaw clenches.

Continues moving toward stage entrance.

---

INT. CONVENTION CENTER - PRODUCTION BOOTH - NIGHT

Level 2. Windowed booth overlooking the hall.

PRODUCTION CREW (3 people) operate video switching equipment.

Screens show "Geoff" speaking live.

Door opens.

Joe and the TRACKTOWN TEAM enter.

PRODUCTION TECH 1
Hey, you can't be in here--

Joe grabs him. Spins him around. Holds him against the wall.

                    JOE
          Nobody gets hurt if you cooperate.

The other two techs raise their hands.

                    TYSON
          Phones. Now.

They hand over their phones.

Tyson pockets them.

RESIDENT 3 (woman, 50s)
Out. All of you.

The techs are pushed out of the booth.

Door locked from inside.

RESIDENT 1 sits at the video controls.

RESIDENT 1
(examining equipment)
I can work with this.

Tyson, texting Adam.

                    TYSON
          In position.

                    JOE
          How long until security notices?

RESIDENT 2
Two minutes. Maybe three.

                    TYSON
          Then we make them count.

---

INT. CONVENTION CENTER - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT

Adam's phone buzzes.

Tyson (TEXT): "In position."

He's near the stage now. Can see Moosk's back 20 feet away.

"Geoff" still speaking.

"GEOFF" (O.S.)
Homelessness. Poverty. These aren't abstract problems. They're human crises. And we have a responsibility--

Adam texts back: "Go."

---

INT. CONVENTION CENTER - PRODUCTION BOOTH - NIGHT

Tyson's phone buzzes.

Adam (TEXT): "Go."

Tyson turns to Resident 1.

                    TYSON
          Do it.

She types rapidly.

Overrides the live feed.

---

INT. CONVENTION CENTER - MAIN HALL - NIGHT

The big screens CUT AWAY from Geoff's live image.

Show instead: CHANNEL 7 NEWS FOOTAGE.

**NEWS ANCHOR (V.O.)**
Breaking news: A body has been discovered inside an Amazing Company shipping container...

Crowd murmurs.

"Geoff" pauses mid-sentence.

Looks at the screens.

"GEOFF"
(to production booth via earpiece)
What's going on? Switch back to live feed.

No response.

The news continues:

**NEWS ANCHOR (V.O.)**
...an anonymous note making unverified claims about CEO Geoffrey...

Crowd getting louder.

Moosk's head turns toward production booth.

Red eyes focusing.

Then the screens change.

BODYCAM FOOTAGE plays.

**OFFICER KANE (V.O. - BODYCAM)**
Police! Anyone here?

POV footage of entering warehouse.

Seeing Adam and the body on the couch.

Then Geoff steps into frame.

Geoff (BODYCAM FOOTAGE)
Officers! Thank goodness you're here.

The crowd watches as Geoff forces Adam toward the corpse.

Geoff (BODYCAM FOOTAGE - CONT'D)
Show them. Show them what you were doing.

Adam kisses the corpse on screen.

Geoff's TITTER LAUGH audible through the speakers.

"Heh-heh-heh."

The police walk away on screen.

AUDIENCE MEMBER 1
Oh my god--

AUDIENCE MEMBER 2
Is that real?

The screens switch to PHOTOS: Adam's documentation.

Broken bones. Torture marks. Victims before disposal. Chemical equipment. Acidic vats.

Each photo more horrifying than the last.

Final image: The preserved body from the news.

Text overlay: "VICTIM #1 OF AT LEAST 15 MURDERS"

The hall erupts.

Screaming.

People standing.

SECURITY converges on the stage, confused.

"Geoff" stands at the podium.

Calm.

Too calm.

He turns toward the screens showing the evidence.

Looks at them for a moment.

Then turns back to the microphone.

"GEOFF"
(dismissive)
Clearly fake. Deepfake technology. Very convincing, but... fake.

He sets the microphone down.

Turns to leave the stage.

AUDIENCE MEMBER 1
That's it? You're just leaving?

"GEOFF"
(without stopping)
I have nothing more to say about obvious fabrications.

Moosk moves to escort him.

The crowd is stunned.

No defense. No panic. Just... dismissal.

Adam watches from backstage.

Sees Geoff walking away.

Unapologetic.

Unconcerned.

Something in Adam snaps.

He bursts from backstage.

Sprinting toward Geoff.

Reaches into his jacket.

Pulls out a KNIFE.

                    ADAM
          YOU KILLED HER!

Security turns.

Too slow.

Adam is steps away from "Geoff."

Knife raised.

Adam PLUNGES the knife into "Geoff's" back.

The blade sinks deep.

"Geoff" staggers.

Then collapses.

Falls to the stage floor.

Motionless.

The crowd SCREAMS.

AUDIENCE MEMBER 1
Oh my god!

AUDIENCE MEMBER 2
He killed him!

Security rushes forward.

Adam stands over the body.

Breathing hard.

Knife still in his hand.

Then:

Moosk's eyes GLOW brighter.

A HOLOGRAM projects from Moosk's head.

GEOFF.

Larger than life. Translucent. Hovering above the stage.

The hologram looks down at Adam.

At the collapsed robot.

Smiles.

                    HOLOGRAM GEOFF
          Nice one.

Beat.

                    HOLOGRAM GEOFF (CONT'D)
          Heh-heh-heh.

Same laugh. Same tone.

Like the poison attempt in Scene 19.

The crowd stares in shock.

Adam looks up at the hologram.

                    ADAM
          What--

The hologram FLICKERS.

FADES.

Disappears.

Security grabs Adam.

Pulls him away from the robot's body.

Adam doesn't resist.

Frozen.

Confused.

What just happened?

---

INT. CONVENTION CENTER - PRODUCTION BOOTH - NIGHT

Tyson and the Tracktown team watch the chaos below.

                    TYSON
          We did it.

                    JOE
          He's finished.

RESIDENT 1
Time to go.

They abandon the booth.

Rush toward the exit stairs.

Behind them: security approaching the locked door.

---

INT. CONVENTION CENTER - MAIN HALL - NIGHT

Adam being led away in handcuffs by security.

He's led toward the exit.

Passes through the crowd.

Some people look horrified.

Others sympathetic.

One woman (60s, wealthy) spits at him.

                    WOMAN
          Monster!

Adam doesn't react.

Keeps walking.

Outside, POLICE CARS wait.

Officers take custody from security.

                    OFFICER
          Adam, last name?

                    ADAM
          Just Adam.

                    OFFICER
          You're under arrest for murder, accessory to murder, obstruction of justice, and improper disposal of human remains.

                    ADAM
          I understand.

They put him in the back of a police car.

As it pulls away, Adam looks out the window.

At the convention center.

At the chaos.

He did it.

Geoff is exposed.

The world knows.

But it was just a robot.

Why was Geoff smiling?

FADE TO:

INT. PRIVATE CONTROL ROOM - CONVENTION CENTER - NIGHT

A small room. Monitors showing the main hall.

The REAL GEOFF sits in a chair, watching the chaos.

Moosk (a SECOND Moosk) stands beside him.

Real geoff laughs.

                    REAL GEOFF
          Heh-heh-heh. HEH-HEH-HEH.

He stands.

Straightens his jacket.

                    REAL GEOFF (CONT'D)
          Time for Act Two.

FADE OUT.
