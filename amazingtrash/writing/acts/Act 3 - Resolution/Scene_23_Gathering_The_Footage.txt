# Scene 23 - Gathering the Footage

## LOCATION
EXT. CITY STREETS / INT. POLICE STATION PARKING LOT / INT. TRACKTOWN - NIGHT

## CHARACTERS
Adam, Officer Kane (night police from Scene 14), Tyson, Joe (Tracktown resident), 4-5 other Tracktown residents

## SCENE LAYOUT

### Opening
Wednesday night. Adam and Tyson stake out the police station, waiting for Officer Kane - one of the two night cops who
walked in on Adam "kissing" the corpse in Scene 14. They know Kane has bodycam footage of the whole incident, with Geoff
clearly visible. That footage is the keystone of the exposure plan. Without it, they just have a body and photos. With
it, they have Geoff on camera at a murder scene, forcing Adam to desecrate a corpse. Undeniable.

### Key Beats
1. **The Stakeout** - Adam and Tyson wait outside police station. Kane finishes his shift, walks to his car alone. They
intercept him.
2. **The Confrontation** - Kane recognizes Adam immediately: "You. From the warehouse." Adam explains what he needs: the
bodycam footage from that night. Kane refuses - he could lose his job, his pension, everything.
3. **The Leverage** - Adam points out that Kane chose not to report a murder. That makes him complicit. If Kane doesn't
help, Adam will make sure Kane goes down with Geoff when the exposure happens. Kane is trapped between two bad options.
4. **The Negotiation** - Kane argues he was following orders (ignore Geoff, don't make waves). Adam doesn't care. Offers
deal: bodycam footage in exchange for anonymity when the exposure happens. Adam won't name Kane as source.
5. **The Deal** - Kane agrees. Goes back into station, pulls up bodycam footage on his phone. Shows it to Adam.
6. **Recording the Footage** - Adam uses his own phone camera to record Kane's phone screen as the bodycam footage plays.
Geoff's titter laugh audible. Adam captures everything: Geoff's face, the body, the crime scene. No USB exchange - just
phone recording phone.
7. **Evidence Complete** - Adam confirms he has the bodycam recording. The news will find security footage when they
investigate after receiving the body. Photos are in Adam's pocket. Everything is ready.
8. **Recruiting Tracktown** - Adam and Tyson meet with Joe and several residents. Adam explains: there's a wealthy man
who's been hurting people, and they have a chance to expose him publicly at his charity event. Need people to help take
over the production feed backstage.
9. **The Team Assembles** - Five Tracktown residents agree to help. Don't know all the details, but trust Adam. They've
seen him contribute to the community. And everyone's tired of rich people stomping on them.
10. **Final Preparations** - Adam has everything now: preserved body (shipped to news), bodycam footage (phone
recording), photos, and a team. Friday night, Geoff's world ends.

### Character Moments
- **Adam**: Calculating and ruthless during the cop confrontation. Uses leverage without hesitation. Gal's death has
eliminated any moral ambiguity - he'll do whatever it takes to destroy Geoff. But when recruiting Tracktown residents,
he's careful not to endanger them more than necessary. Doesn't reveal everything. Protects them by keeping them partially
ignorant.
- **Officer Kane**: Trapped and bitter. Knows he should've reported the warehouse incident but didn't because Geoff has
power. Now Adam is using that cowardice against him. Hates being blackmailed but has no choice. Recognizes Adam is right
- he's complicit whether he wants to admit it or not.
- **Tyson**: Acts as Adam's partner now, not just follower. Helps with stakeout, watches Kane to make sure he doesn't
run, reviews footage with Adam. The grief has hardened him into someone capable of carrying out a revenge plan.
- **Joe**: Represents Tracktown community. Doesn't ask too many questions when Adam recruits him. Knows Adam is one of
them now, and if Adam says this is important, it is. Willing to take risks for someone who's proven they belong.

### Closing
Everything is in place. Thursday morning the body will be discovered by news. Thursday afternoon the story breaks. Friday
night at the charity gala, Adam will play the footage for the world. Geoff won't be able to run, deny, or escape. The
countdown is ticking. Adam alone in the secret chamber, watching the phone recording of bodycam footage - Geoff's titter
laugh echoing. The promise to Gal. One more day.

## FULL SCRIPT

EXT. POLICE STATION - PARKING LOT - NIGHT

Wednesday, 11:30 PM.

Adam and TYSON sit in shadows across the street from the station.

Watching. Waiting.

                    TYSON
          You sure he's working tonight?

                    ADAM
          Checked the duty roster online. Kane. Night shift. Off at midnight.

                    TYSON
          And if he doesn't want to help?

                    ADAM
          Then we make him want to.

They watch the station entrance.

Officers come and go. Shift change approaching.

                    TYSON
          What if he pulls a gun?

                    ADAM
          He won't.

                    TYSON
          How do you know?

                    ADAM
          Because he's already guilty. He knows it.

11:57 PM.

The doors open.

OFFICER KANE (late 40s, tired) exits the station.

Alone.

Walks toward the parking lot.

                    ADAM (CONT'D)
          That's him.

They move.

---

EXT. POLICE STATION - PARKING LOT - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

Kane reaches his car. Pulls out keys.

Adam (O.S.)
Officer Kane.

Kane spins around.

Sees Adam and Tyson approaching.

His hand goes to his hip instinctively (gun).

                    KANE
          Stop right there.

Adam, hands visible, non-threatening.

                    ADAM
          We just want to talk.

                    KANE
          I don't know you.

                    ADAM
          Yeah, you do. Warehouse district. Two weeks ago. You and your partner walked in on a... situation.

Kane's expression shifts. Recognition.

                    KANE
          You.

                    ADAM
          Me.

Kane, looking at Tyson.

                    KANE
          Who's he?

                    TYSON
          A friend.

Kane's hand stays near his gun.

                    KANE
          You shouldn't be here.

                    ADAM
          I need something from you.

                    KANE
          Not interested.

                    ADAM
          You haven't heard what it is yet.

                    KANE
          Don't care. We're done here.

He turns back to his car.

                    ADAM
          I need the bodycam footage. From that night.

Kane freezes.

Slowly turns around.

                    KANE
          What?

                    ADAM
          Your bodycam. You were recording when you entered the warehouse. I need that footage.

Kane laughs.

                    KANE
          You're out of your mind.

                    ADAM
          No. I'm serious.

                    KANE
          Even if I wanted to help you - which I don't - that's evidence. I can't just hand over police footage.

                    ADAM
          It's only evidence if there's a case. And you didn't file a report, did you?

Kane's jaw tightens.

                    ADAM (CONT'D)
          You saw a dead body. You saw Geoffrey. You saw what he was doing. And you walked away.

                    KANE
          I was following orders.

                    ADAM
          Whose orders?

                    KANE
          My sergeant. He said... he said to let it go. Geoff's untouchable.

                    ADAM
          So you chose your paycheck over doing the right thing.

Kane, defensive.

                    KANE
          You don't know what it's like. Geoff owns half this city. Politicians. Judges. Cops. If I reported it, I'd be
          fired. Maybe worse.

                    ADAM
          And that makes it okay?

                    KANE
          No. But it makes it survival.

Beat.

                    ADAM
          I'm going to expose him. Publicly. At his charity event Friday night.

Kane, scoffing.

                    KANE
          Good luck with that.

                    ADAM
          I'm serious. I have evidence. A body. Photos. Security footage. But I need your bodycam footage to make it
          stick.

                    KANE
          Why?

                    ADAM
          Because it shows Geoff at the scene. Shows him forcing me to... to do what I did. Shows you and your partner
          choosing not to act.

Kane steps back.

                    KANE
          You're trying to implicate me.

                    ADAM
          No. I'm giving you a chance to do the right thing.

                    KANE
          By blackmailing me?

                    ADAM
          By offering you a choice.

Tyson, stepping forward.

                    TYSON
          You can help us take down Geoff. Anonymously. No one knows the footage came from you.

                    ADAM
          Or I can make sure everyone knows you were there that night and did nothing.

                    KANE
          You have no proof I was there.

                    ADAM
          Your badge number was visible when you shined your flashlight. I remember it: 4719. And your partner: 4892. If
          I release that information along with the warehouse location and timestamp, Internal Affairs will investigate.

Kane, angry.

                    KANE
          You're bluffing.

                    ADAM
          Am I?

Silence.

Kane realizes Adam isn't bluffing.

                    KANE
          What do you want?

                    ADAM
          The bodycam footage. That's all.

                    KANE
          And you won't name me as the source?

                    ADAM
          Not unless you force me to.

                    KANE
          How do I know you'll keep your word?

                    ADAM
          Because I don't care about you. I care about Geoff. You're just a cop who made a bad call. He's a serial
          killer.

Kane looks between Adam and Tyson.

Weighs his options.

                    KANE
          If this traces back to me, I'm dead. Geoff will make sure of it.

                    ADAM
          Then don't let it trace back. Help us, and when Geoff goes down, you're just another cop who didn't know what
          was happening.

                    KANE
          And if your plan fails?

                    ADAM
          It won't.

                    KANE
          How do you know?

                    ADAM
          Because I have nothing left to lose.

Kane studies Adam's face.

Sees the truth there.

Kane, sighing.

                    KANE
          Wait here.

He walks back toward the station.

Tyson looks at Adam.

                    TYSON
          Think he'll do it?

                    ADAM
          He doesn't have a choice.

They wait.

Ten minutes pass.

Kane re-emerges from the station.

Crosses to Adam.

Pulls out his PHONE.

                    KANE
          This never happened.

                    ADAM
          Agreed.

Kane opens a video file on his phone.

                    KANE
          The footage is from my bodycam. Unedited. Timestamp intact. It shows... everything.

Holds the phone up.

BODYCAM FOOTAGE plays:

**INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT (FOOTAGE)**

POV: Officer Kane's chest-mounted camera.

Kane and his partner enter the warehouse.

Flashlights sweeping.

KANE (V.O. - FOOTAGE)
Police! Anyone here?

They move deeper into the warehouse.

See the COUCH.

See ADAM sitting next to a BODY.

KANE (V.O. - FOOTAGE - CONT'D)
Sir, step away from--

Geoff steps into frame.

Smiling.

Geoff (FOOTAGE)
Officers! Thank goodness you're here.

KANE (V.O. - FOOTAGE)
Mr. Geoffrey?

Geoff (FOOTAGE)
That's right. I own this building. Caught these two trespassing.

The camera shifts to Adam and the body.

Adam is visibly terrified.

Geoff (FOOTAGE - CONT'D)
Seems like they were having a... private moment. If you know what I mean.

Kane's camera focuses on Geoff's face.

The titter laugh visible.

Geoff (V.O. - FOOTAGE)
Heh-heh-heh.

---

EXT. POLICE STATION - PARKING LOT - NIGHT (BACK TO PRESENT)

Adam pulls out his OWN phone.

Opens the camera.

Points it at Kane's phone screen.

Starts recording.

The bodycam footage plays on Kane's screen while Adam's camera captures it.

GEOFF'S TITTER LAUGH audible from Kane's phone speakers.

"Heh-heh-heh."

Adam keeps recording.

Tyson watches Kane to make sure he doesn't run.

After a minute, the footage ends.

Adam stops recording.

                    ADAM
          Thank you.

                    KANE
          Don't thank me. I'm not doing this for you. I'm doing it because I'm tired of being scared of him.

He pockets his phone.

Gets in his car.

Kane (cont'd), through window.

                    KANE (CONT'D)
          Good luck. You're going to need it.

Drives away.

Adam and Tyson stand in the parking lot.

                    TYSON
          You got it all?

Adam checks his phone recording.

                    ADAM
          Yeah. Geoff's face. The body. Everything.

                    TYSON
          What about the other footage? Security cameras from the other kills?

                    ADAM
          Already handled. News will find the clips when they investigate after getting the body.

                    TYSON
          And your photos?

Adam pats his jacket pocket.

                    ADAM
          Right here.

                    TYSON
          So we have everything?

                    ADAM
          Everything we need.

---

EXT. RAILYARD - TRACKTOWN - NIGHT

LATER.

Adam and Tyson meet with JOE and FIVE OTHER TRACKTOWN RESIDENTS.

Small fire. Everyone sitting in a circle.

                    JOE
          What's this about, Adam?

                    ADAM
          I need your help with something.

RESIDENT 1 (woman, 30s)
What kind of help?

                    ADAM
          There's a man. Very wealthy. Very powerful. He's been hurting people. Killing them.

Murmurs around the circle.

                    JOE
          Who?

                    ADAM
          I can't say yet. But Friday night, there's a charity event downtown. He'll be there. On stage. In front of
          cameras.

RESIDENT 2 (man, 40s)
And?

                    ADAM
          And I'm going to expose him. Show the world what he's done.

                    TYSON
          We have evidence. Photos. Videos. Everything.

                    ADAM
          But we need to take over the production feed. Play our footage on the big screens while he's on stage.

RESIDENT 3 (woman, 50s)
That's... that's a big ask.

                    ADAM
          I know.

                    JOE
          Why us?

                    ADAM
          Because you're people Geoff doesn't know. He has surveillance on me. On Tyson. But not on you.

RESIDENT 1
Geoff? As in Geoffrey? Amazing Company Geoff?

Adam nods.

RESIDENT 1 (CONT'D)
Holy shit.

RESIDENT 2
He's a billionaire. You can't just--

                    ADAM
          Yes, I can. And I will. With or without you.

                    JOE
          What do you need us to do?

                    ADAM
          Get backstage. Take control of the production booth. Play the footage when I give the signal.

                    TYSON
          It'll be five minutes. Maybe less. Then you run.

RESIDENT 3
What about security?

                    ADAM
          I'll handle that.

                    JOE
          How?

                    ADAM
          I have my ways.

The residents exchange glances.

RESIDENT 2
If we get caught--

                    ADAM
          You won't. I'll make sure of it.

                    JOE
          And if we do?

                    ADAM
          Then I take the blame. All of it. You were just hired help who didn't know what videos you were playing.

Silence.

Joe looks at the others.

                    JOE
          I'm in.

RESIDENT 1
Me too.

RESIDENT 3
Count me in.

One by one, they all agree.

Six people total.

Adam nods.

                    ADAM
          Thank you. All of you.

                    JOE
          We take care of our own. You're one of us now, Adam.

Adam's throat tightens.

                    ADAM
          Friday night. 8 PM. Meet me at the back entrance of the convention center. I'll have passes ready.

They nod.

The meeting breaks up.

Residents drift back to their shelters.

Joe stays behind with Adam and Tyson.

                    JOE
          This is about Gal, isn't it?

Adam and Tyson exchange looks.

                    ADAM
          What?

                    JOE
          I haven't seen her in a couple days. And you two have been... different. Colder.

                    TYSON
          She left. Went to try her luck in another city.

                    JOE
          Did she.

                    TYSON
          Yeah.

Joe doesn't believe them but doesn't push.

                    JOE
          Well. If Geoff had anything to do with her leaving... I'm glad we're making him pay.

He walks away.

Adam and Tyson stand alone.

                    TYSON
          He knows.

                    ADAM
          Yeah.

                    TYSON
          Should we tell him?

                    ADAM
          No. The less people know, the safer they are.

                    TYSON
          When this is over... do we tell everyone what really happened to her?

                    ADAM
          Maybe. If we survive.

They head back to the secret chamber.

---

INT. RAILYARD - SECRET CHAMBER - LATE NIGHT

Adam and Tyson sit surrounded by evidence.

Photos printed and organized.

Adam's phone showing body shipment tracking: "Out for delivery - Thursday 8 AM."

Another phone recording of Kane's bodycam footage.

                    ADAM
          Everything's ready.

                    TYSON
          Thursday the news breaks.

                    ADAM
          Friday we finish it.

                    TYSON
          And then?

                    ADAM
          Then Geoff goes to prison. And we... we try to move on.

                    TYSON
          Will we? Be able to move on?

Adam looks at the empty acidic vat.

Where Gal was dissolved.

                    ADAM
          I don't know.

They sit in silence.

The weight of what they've done - and what they're about to do - settling over them.

                    TYSON
          Gal would've liked this. The plan. Taking him down publicly.

                    ADAM
          Yeah. She would've.

                    TYSON
          I wish she was here to see it.

                    ADAM
          Me too.

                    ADAM (CONT'D)
          Get some sleep. Tomorrow's going to be a long day.

                    TYSON
          You coming?

                    ADAM
          In a bit.

Tyson climbs the ladder.

Gone.

Adam alone.

He looks at the evidence one more time.

This is it.

Fifteen victims.

Gal.

All of them about to be avenged.

He pulls out his phone.

Opens the recording of Kane's bodycam footage.

Watches it. Geoff's face on screen. The titter laugh.

Adam (cont'd) turns to the phone, to Gal.

                    ADAM (CONT'D)
          I'm going to make this right. I promise.

FADE OUT.

## Production Notes
- Police station parking lot: dark, isolated, late-night atmosphere
- Officer Kane: tired, bitter, trapped between fear and guilt
- Kane shows bodycam footage on his phone - plays beginning of Scene 14 footage
- Adam records Kane's phone screen with his own phone camera
- IMPORTANT: Geoff's titter laugh ("Heh-heh-heh") audible during recording - this is key audio evidence
- No USB exchange - just phone recording phone
- Security camera footage from other kills found offscreen by news (mentioned in dialogue only)
- Tracktown meeting: small fire, intimate circle, community trust
- Joe's suspicion about Gal: knows something is wrong but doesn't press
- Evidence compilation: photos, phone recording of bodycam footage
- Tracking notification: "Out for delivery - Thursday 8 AM" builds tension
- Final moment: Adam watches phone recording, hears Geoff's titter laugh, promise to Gal
- Countdown: One more day until exposure
