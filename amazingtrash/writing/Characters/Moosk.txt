## RELATIONSHIPS
- **Geoff**: Perfect loyalty. Protects Geoff, enforces his will, participates in murders, prevents assassination attempts.
- **Adam**: Intimidates and threatens Adam. Catches Adam's gas assassination attempt. Restrains Adam while Tracktown is gassed.
- **Victims**: May do the actual killing. "The Moosk Special" involves tearing limbs off with mechanical precision.

## CHARACTER ARC
Moosk doesn't have an arc - he's a machine. He functions as an extension of Geoff's power throughout the entire story.

**Act 1**: Participates in murders → Catches Adam witnessing → Threatens Adam → Helps with body disposal jobs

**Act 2**: Present during Adam's paranoia → Surveillance catches Adam slipping gas pill into Geoff's food → Analyzes the gas → Helps kill T or Gal

**Act 3**: Protects Geoff during confrontation → Restrains Adam → Forces Adam to watch Tracktown gassing

## DIALOGUE STYLE
- Minimal dialogue (if any)
- Likely robotic/flat delivery
- Communicates through actions rather than words (eye flashes, nods, physical movements)
- **Non-verbal efficiency**: Single eye flash = acknowledgment. Single nod = compliance. No unnecessary communication.
- Instant execution of commands without verbal confirmation needed

## KEY SCENES

**Act 1, Scene 1: The Witness** - Assists Geoff in helium innertube murder with cold efficiency. Detects Adam with surveillance ("Motion detected. Human signature"). Moves impossibly fast to capture Adam, drags him to Geoff with mechanical precision. Grip tightens as warning when Adam hesitates.

**Act 1, Scene 2: The Offer** - On Geoff's command ("You know the drill"), begins choking Adam. Stops instantly when Geoff signals. Releases throat but maintains arm grip. Tightens grip as warning when Adam hesitates to take business card. Perfect obedience - no hesitation, no emotion, pure efficiency in enforcing Geoff's will.

**Act 1, Scene 5: The Deal** - Silent presence during Adam's payment meeting. When Geoff says "Moosk will contact you," robot's head turns toward Adam. Red eyes scan and memorize. Watches Adam leave with blank mechanical eyes. Establishes surveillance/contact role for future jobs.

**Act 1, Scene 6: The Moosk Special** - Stands with blood-stained hands after beating suspended victim while Geoff supervised. On Geoff's order "Show him how it's done," punches victim with piston-like mechanical force ("CRUNCH" - ribs breaking). Ordered to get body down ("Acknowledged"), brutally rips it through restraints with inhuman strength, breaking victim's hands. Leaves bloody boot prints. Pure efficiency in violence.

**Act 1, Scene 8: The Public Kill** - Silent presence during public plaza kill. Walks away casually with Geoff after leaving body for Adam to handle. No concern for witnesses or cameras. Perfect loyalty to Geoff's escalating recklessness.

**Act 2, Scene 13: Standard Night on the Town** - Silent presence at restaurant and casino. When Geoff orders "$500 for supplies," Moosk's eyes flash once in acknowledgment and instantly transfers money. No words needed - pure efficiency. Tracks every movement in restaurant with red eyes scanning constantly. Follows Geoff to VIP area during murder. Ordered to "assist" Adam with body disposal - nods once. Perfect obedience.

**Act 2, Scene 14: The Almost Busted** - Stands in shadows while Geoff sits on couch with corpse. When police arrive and young officer persists in investigation, Moosk shifts slightly as reminder of threat. Officer immediately backs down. When Adam hesitates to kiss corpse, Moosk takes one step closer - silent physical threat. After Geoff leaves, waits patiently for Adam to finish vomiting, then lifts body effortlessly. Stands holding corpse, waiting. No reaction to Adam's breakdown. Pure mechanical efficiency enforcing Geoff's will.

**Act 2, Scene 16: I'm Out** - Scans Tracktown on arrival, red eyes assessing threats. When Geoff asks for data, delivers chilling precision: "Sixty-three residents currently present. An additional twenty-one frequent the area... Total: eighty-four individuals. Facial recognition complete. Social connections mapped." Demonstrates complete surveillance capability. When Adam lunges at Geoff, catches him mid-step with one hand, lifts him off ground by shirt collar effortlessly. Releases on command. Before leaving, pauses to look at Adam - red eyes flash once, capturing everything. Silent reminder of constant surveillance.

**Act 2, Scene 19: Planning the Exposure** - Detects Adam's assassination attempt instantly: "Alert. Unidentified chemical compound detected. Source: subject Adam." Moves impossibly fast to grab Adam's wrist. Red laser grid scans capsule, identifies: "Synthetic neurotoxin. Lethal dosage. Delivery method: gaseous dispersal upon contact with liquid." Crushes Adam's hand (not breaking, just overwhelming pressure) to extract capsule. On Geoff's command "Destroy that," crushes capsule bare-handed - "Acknowledged." Perfect defensive system. Makes Geoff untouchable. Sends text later: "Consequences. -M"

**Act 2, Scene 20: Retribution** - Executes Gal during the night. Clean professional kill - broken neck, no struggle. Places body in Adam's secret chamber where only he would find it. At dawn, sits in auto-car with hologram projector showing Geoff's message. Red eyes glowing. Silent during entire encounter - lets hologram speak. Drives away without a word after delivering threat. Perfect executioner. Makes Geoff's retribution personal and terrifying.

**Act 3, Scene 24: The Body Discovered** - Analyzes body shipment threat: "Package traced to Amazing Company shipping facility. Sent Wednesday, 2:34 PM. Payment from unregistered account. No surveillance footage recovered." When Geoff identifies Adam as culprit, provides probability assessment: "Probability: High. Recent assassination attempt supports hypothesis." Recommends immediate termination: "Eliminate Adam immediately." When Geoff refuses, acknowledges: "Risk assessment: Moderate to high." Begins monitoring Adam's location in Tracktown. Reports: "Tracktown. No suspicious activity detected." Red eyes scanning constantly during press conference for threats. Silent sentinel protecting Geoff.

**Act 3, Scene 25: The Exposure** - TWO MOOSKS EXIST: One accompanies robot Geoff onstage at gala, other stays with real Geoff in control room. Moosk #1 (with robot) stands at stage edge, red eyes continuously scanning crowd for threats. When screens show evidence, immediately identifies source: turns toward production booth. When Adam emerges onstage, calculates threat level. During evacuation, protects robot double: "Negative. Perimeter is not secure" when security wants to move. Escorts robot Geoff through backstage to auto-car efficiently. Moosk #2 (with real Geoff) stands silent in control room, watching monitors. Both Moosks demonstrate coordinated protection of Geoff's dual-presence strategy.

**Act 3, Scene 26: Geoff's Mask Drops** - Moosk stands with real Geoff at press conference. Silent presence. Wheels out destroyed robot double on gurney when Geoff reveals the frame job. Red eyes scanning media and crowd continuously for threats. When Geoff threatens Tracktown team with facial recognition, Moosk has already processed surveillance footage and identified targets. Perfect enforcement system ready to execute final retribution.

**Act 3, Scene 27-28: The Massacre** - Accompanies Geoff to Tracktown in auto-car. Scans encampment: "Sixty-seven residents currently present. Seventeen absent." Provides facial recognition: "Six individuals identified. Five confirmed present. One unaccounted for" (Adam in custody). Opens loudspeaker from chest for Geoff's announcement. Activates five-minute countdown on drones. When time expires, inputs command on tablet - drones release gas canisters. Monitors massacre via drone feeds. Reports to Geoff: "Eighty-four confirmed terminations. Zero survivors. Evidence sanitized." Orders drones to precision-shoot reanimated bodies to "clean it up." Transmits drone camera feed to police interrogation room so Adam is forced to watch. Perfect execution of mass murder with zero emotion. Ultimate enforcer - ensures Geoff's retribution is complete and untraceable. Evidence ties drones to shell corporation, not Amazing Company. Geoff never charged.
