## KEY SCENES

**Act 1, Scene 11: Meeting Gal** - At bodega buying last coffee Adam needs. He offers to buy anything else in store for it. Recognizes his integrity: "Keeping your word matters, huh?" Makes deal, tests him with expensive items. Understands when Adam explains: "I haven't been good at keeping promises lately. So when I can... I do." Adam invites her to barbecue. Walks back with Adam and Tyson, laughing together. Observes community: "This is nice. You've got a good thing here." Toasts with them: "To friends." Beginning of friend trio.

**Act 2, Scene 18: Mid Night Out** - At dinner, teaches Tyson manners gently. Grateful for meal: "Best meal I've had in... maybe ever." When Adam wants to continue the night, refuses: "I don't want to get used to this." Explains she's trying to get OUT of Tracktown, can't get comfortable: "If I get used to good things, it'll hurt more when they stop." Calls Adam's behavior "desperate" - "Like you're trying too hard. Buying friendship." Tries to help: "I care about you, Adam. But I need to protect myself." Leaves when conversation sours. Protecting herself by being realistic but accidentally pushing Adam away at worst possible time. Last interaction with Adam was a fight. Never escaped Tracktown.

**Act 2, Scene 20: Retribution** - Found dead in Adam's secret chamber. Killed by Moosk (broken neck) as punishment for Adam's assassination attempt. Body left for Adam to find - message from Geoff. Never got to apologize to Adam, never got to escape, never achieved her dreams. Died still warm - happened maybe an hour before discovery. The good things stopped permanently, exactly as she feared.
