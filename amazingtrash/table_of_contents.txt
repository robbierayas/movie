They eat steak at an expensive restaurant - Geoff casually dismisses it as "mid." At the casino, they play craps. Adam nervously asks Geoff for some extra money for supplies - it seems like a lot to Adam but nothing compared to what they're gambling. As the night goes on and Adam gets drunk, he loosens up and jokes that something is "mid," mimicking Geoff's slang. Eventually, Geoff kills someone (possibly in the casino or nearby). He tells Adam to take care of it and leaves. Adam realizes the whole generous night out was just about getting him to dispose of another body. Geoff's "friendship" is pure manipulation.

Geoff forces Adam to pretend to make out with the body to hide it from the police. Adam and police both grossed out but continue charade out of fear.

Gal says she doesn't want to get used to the good life - she's hoping to get out of Tracktown someday. Somehow the conversation turns sour and Gal goes off separately for the night. Tyson and Adam head home, but Adam says the wrong thing while angry about the talk with Gal. Tyson runs off on his own. As the quiet sets in, Adam hears a drone overhead.
