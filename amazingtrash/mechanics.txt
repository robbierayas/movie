## 1. ECONOMIC DISPARITY - THE THREE-TIER SYSTEM

### Overview

The near-future society has stratified into a semi-enforced three-tier class system. The tiers are marked on government identification and public signage, creating visible segregation and institutionalized inequality. The system is maintained through a combination of economic policy, welfare programs, and social control.

### Standard Class (Blue "S")

**Official Designation:** Standard
**ID Marker:** Blue "S" on identification
**Signage:** Blue "S" on establishments, services, and areas

**Characteristics:**
- The wealthy/rich class
- Not on any form of government welfare
- Fully housed in traditional residential areas
- Access to premium services, healthcare, education
- Largely oblivious to the problems of the poor
- Insulated from lower classes through economic and physical barriers

**Lifestyle:**
- Live in secure, well-maintained housing
- Access to private transportation
- High-quality healthcare and education
- Can afford luxury goods and services
- Social circles limited to other Standard class members
- May have robot bodyguards (like Geoff and Moosk)

**Relationship to Lower Classes:**
- Minimal contact with Mid or Unhoused classes
- May employ Mid class workers in service roles
- Generally unaware of or indifferent to poverty conditions
- View class system as natural order or meritocracy
- Protected from consequences of their actions by wealth and influence

### Mid Class / Welfare Recipients (Red "M")

**Official Designation:** Welfare Recipients
**Colloquial Name:** "Mid" or "Mids"
**ID Marker:** Red "M" on identification (regardless of how much welfare they receive)
**Signage:** Red "M" on establishments, services, and areas

**Characteristics:**
- The working poor and lower-middle class
- Receive any amount of government welfare (housing assistance, food stamps, healthcare subsidies)
- Housed but not wealthy - living in subsidized or affordable housing
- May be employed but wages insufficient for self-sufficiency
- Stigmatized by the red marker on their ID

**Lifestyle:**
- Live in basic but functional housing (apartments, tenements, subsidized units)
- Limited access to services and amenities
- Public transportation or no transportation
- Basic healthcare and education
- Must navigate red "M" restrictions on certain services or areas
- Constant financial stress and precarity

**Economic Reality:**
- Even full-time work often doesn't pay enough to escape welfare dependency
- The red marker follows them regardless of welfare amount
- Once on welfare, difficult to escape the Mid designation
- May have come from Unhoused class or fallen from Standard class
- Fear of becoming Unhoused is constant pressure

**Social Position:**
- Look down on Unhoused but are closer to them than to Standard
- May work service jobs for Standard class
- Some Standard establishments won't serve them or charge higher prices
- Form the bulk of the working population

### Unhoused Class (Black "U")

**Official Designation:** Unhoused
**Colloquial Name:** Various (often derogatory)
**ID Marker:** No marker, but ID has no address listed
**Signage:** Black "U" on establishments, services, and areas

**Characteristics:**
- The homeless population
- No permanent address on identification
- Not housed by government or private means
- Live in encampments like Tracktown, on streets, in shelters
- Often excluded from services and opportunities

**Lifestyle:**
- Live in illegal housing, temporary shelters, or on the streets
- Limited access to clean water, sanitation, electricity
- Rely on informal economy, charity, scavenging, crime
- Black "U" signage indicates where they're allowed or excluded
- Constant threat of displacement, harassment, or violence
- Form their own communities for survival (like Tracktown)

**Economic Reality:**
- In this near-future, low-wage workers expect to be homeless
- Many have jobs but wages don't cover housing costs
- Some are functionally employed but live in Tracktown to afford food and other necessities
- The Unhoused designation makes it harder to get hired for better jobs
- No address means difficulty accessing services, banking, etc.

**Social Position:**
- Bottom of the social hierarchy
- Invisible to Standard class, pitied or despised by Mid class
- Develop strong community bonds within encampments
- Subject to police harassment and displacement efforts
- Some areas tolerate them (like Tracktown), others actively exclude them

### How the System Works

**Identification and Markers:**
- Government-issued IDs have color-coded markers (Blue S, Red M, or none/Black U)
- Markers are visible on physical ID cards and digital identification
- Once marked, difficult to change classification
- Businesses and services use markers to discriminate legally or semi-legally

**Public Signage:**
- Establishments display Blue S, Red M, or Black U signs to indicate who they serve
- Some places are Standard-only (Blue S)
- Some serve Mid and above (Red M and Blue S)
- Few places explicitly welcome Unhoused (Black U)
- Gyms, cafeterias, public pools use tiered pricing or access (like in Scene 4)

**Government Role:**
- System is semi-enforced by government policy
- Welfare programs create the Red M designation
- Housing policy and zoning creates Unhoused class
- Police enforce property rights and displacement
- Minimal social services for Unhoused (by design)

**Economic Mechanism:**
- Wages stagnate while housing costs skyrocket
- Welfare programs provide just enough to survive but trap recipients in Mid class
- Standard class accumulates wealth while lower classes struggle
- Automation and robotics reduce need for workers
- Billionaires like Geoff have unprecedented power and wealth

**Transportation:**
- All cars are auto-pilot (self-driving)
- Standard class has access to private auto-pilot vehicles (like Geoff's Amazing Company car)
- Mid class uses public auto-pilot transportation or rideshares
- Unhoused class walks almost everywhere - can't afford auto-pilot services
- Walking is a visible marker of poverty in this society
- Auto-pilot cars can be summoned, used for deliveries, or sent away remotely

### Social Implications

**For the Story:**
- Adam is Unhoused class, living in Tracktown
- Geoff is Standard class, wielding immense power and privilege
- Tyson and Gal are Unhoused class, part of Tracktown community
- Scene 4 shows the tiered system at the gym/cafeteria
- Police tolerate Tracktown but "riot control" dumps homeless protesters there
- The final drone attack on Tracktown is genocide against the Unhoused class

**Themes:**
- Extreme economic inequality
- Dehumanization of the poor
- Powerlessness against billionaire class
- Community and solidarity among the dispossessed
- Violence as means of social control
- No escape from systemic oppression

**Visual Markers:**
- Blue, Red, and Black signage throughout the city
- ID checks at establishments
- Physical segregation of classes
- Contrast between Standard luxury and Tracktown poverty
- Amazing Company's smiley face logo as corporate mask over atrocity

================================================================================

## 2. TRACKTOWN - THE HOMELESS ENCAMPMENT

### Location and Geography

**General Location:**
- On the outskirts of Houston or New York (to be determined)
- Built in a swampy, unbuildable area that developers abandoned
- Former industrial railyard that was decommissioned
- Marshy terrain makes conventional construction impossible
- City authorities consider it a "lost zone" - not worth the cost to demolish or reclaim

**The Railyard:**
- Abandoned railroad tracks run through the area
- Tracks are no longer in use but remain intact
- The illegal structures are built everywhere EXCEPT directly on the tracks
- Tracks serve as natural pathways/streets through the settlement with dirt path roads branching off

### Architecture and Structure

**The Defining Feature - Stacked Train Cars:**
- Abandoned train cars removed from the tracks and stacked vertically on their side with doors open so the middle is a stairwell between floors
- Stacks range from 2 to 5 cars high
- Most structures use ladders for vertical access (cheaper, easier to build)
- Only a few premium locations have stairs (mark of status/investment)
- Train cars modified with windows, doors cut into sides, insulation added
- Some cars connected by walkways/bridges at higher levels
- Creates a distinctive skyline visible from a distance

**Other Building Types:**
- Shipping containers (single and stacked)
- Corrugated metal structures
- Reclaimed materials (plywood, tarps, scrap metal)
- Some more "permanent" looking buildings made from salvaged materials
- A few structures that almost look like legitimate tiny homes
- Mix of individual dwellings and multi-unit structures

**Overall Appearance:**
- From a distance, looks like a strange, vertical shantytown
- Up close, appears more like a quirky, unconventional neighborhood
- Some residents have added paint, gardens, decorations
- Not obviously dystopian - could pass for an "alternative community" to outsiders
- The verticality and improvised nature make it unique but not necessarily desperate-looking

### Infrastructure Systems

**Plumbing:**
- Jury-rigged from multiple water sources (old industrial pipes, unauthorized taps)
- Network of visible pipes running between structures
- Some pipes run underground through the swampy soil
- Frequent leaks and repairs needed
- Hot water is a luxury - most residents use cold water or heat it themselves
- Community water points where people gather to fill containers
- Drainage is haphazard - some areas prone to flooding

**Electrical:**
- Unauthorized connections to nearby power grid
- Tangle of wires running overhead and underground haphazardly connected to structures where they can
- Some structures have generators (noisy, expensive to run)
- Frequent outages from wire breaking or disconnecting
- Some residents are skilled electricians who maintain the system
- Certain areas have more reliable power than others

**The Crawlspaces:**
- Network of narrow passages beneath and between structures
- Created by:
  - Gaps under raised train cars and shipping containers
  - Spaces between stacked units
  - Old industrial tunnels and maintenance areas from the railyard era
  - Intentionally constructed hidden passages
- Most residents don't know about all of them
- Adam has mapped many of these passages
- Skilled workers (plumbers, electricians, builders) are seen at times rushing from crawlspace to crawlspace
- Used for:
  - Utility line access
  - Storage
  - Movement without being seen
  - Adam's secret lab access
- Some crawlspaces are through swampy ground (wet, muddy)
- Others are through dry industrial spaces (concrete, metal)
- Tight, claustrophobic, often dark

**Adam's Secret Lab:**
- Accessed through multiple crawlspace routes
- Hidden in support structure beneath the settlement
- Well-stocked with chemistry equipment (stolen, salvaged, carefully acquired)
- Connected to the acidic waste disposal area
- Power tapped from the grid illegally
- Ventilation system cobbled together from old industrial fans
- Only Adam knows all the access routes
- Lab is surprisingly organized and professional-looking
- Contains equipment that would be expensive on the black market

### Safety and Governance

**Police Presence:**
- Police do patrol Tracktown main area like shops
- It's safe enough for officers to enter on foot (during daytime)
- Police generally tolerate the settlement:
  - Some police grew up there
  - Tracktown is legally accepted area to live
  - Some individual officers are less toleraant
- Police mostly respond to specific complaints or incidents
- Night patrols are rare - considered waste of taxpayer money
- "Riot control" teams from other parts of the city will dump homeless protesters in Tracktown

**Possible Criminal Element:**
- May have organized crime presence (mafia, gang, or local power structure)
- Could involve:
  - Protection money/extortion
  - Control of electrical/plumbing and charge access but they have to keep it working to avoid unrest
  - Underground economy management
  - Conflict resolution/informal justice system
- Not overtly violent or chaotic, the "Night Police"
- Maintains enough order to keep police from cracking down
- Residents may accept it as Tracktown has no organization in charge of utilities

**Community Rules:**
- Informal governance by long-term residents
- Disputes settled through negotiation or informal authority figures
- Shared maintenance of common infrastructure
- Unwritten rules about theft, violence, noise
- Newcomers expected to contribute and respect existing community
- Some cooperation for mutual defense/support

### Community Dynamics

**Economic Disparity Context:**
- In this near-future, low-wage workers expect to be homeless
- Tracktown represents semi-permanent homelessness
- Residents range from employed people who can't afford housing to completely destitute
- Some residents have jobs in the city - Tracktown is their affordable "housing"
- Creates a functioning community rather than transient population

**Social Structure:**
- Long-term residents have better structures, more established positions
- Newer arrivals live in worse conditions as they have been unable to afford mid housing
- Some residents run informal businesses (food, repairs, goods)
- Children like Tyson grow up here - it's their normal

**Daily Life:**
- People cook communally in some areas (barbecues mentioned in scenes)
- Bodega/shops nearby where residents buy supplies
- Social gathering spots emerge organically
- Despite poverty, life has routines and normalcy
- Community bonds form around shared circumstances

**Adam's Place in Tracktown:**
- Initially withdrawn and avoiding people
- Has knowledge of hidden infrastructure others don't
- His chemistry skills are unusual but he keeps them hidden at first
- As he gets money, he shares with community and gains acceptance
- Becomes part of the social fabric through friendships with Tyson and Gal

================================================================================

## 3. STREET SCAMS - SURVIVAL TACTICS

In the digital future economy, traditional paper-based scams are obsolete. Adam, Tyson, and Gal use clever tactics adapted to the three-tier society to extract money from the Standard and Mid classes.

### Broken Item Reversal (Medicine Drop)

**How It Works:**
- Scammer carries expensive medicine, medical device, or valuable item (not broken, or already broken)
- "Accidentally" bumps into Standard class mark
- Drops the item, acts devastated
- Claims it needs expensive "disinfection" or "recalibration" after being contaminated/damaged
- Has pre-prepared digital payment receipt ready on device
- Victim taps phone quickly in the rush to get away from the confrontation
- Receipt is designed to look legitimate but routes payment to scammer

**Why It Works:**
- Standard class wants to avoid confrontation with Unhoused
- Digital payment is quick and feels "official"
- Medical items create urgency and guilt
- Pre-made receipt gives illusion of legitimacy

**Scene Usage:**
- Scene 8: Tyson uses this scam, mentions "old jester down the way" can fix it

### Handshake Watch Steal

**How It Works:**
- Scammer approaches Standard class mark with friendly greeting or question
- Initiates handshake or physical contact
- During contact, deftly removes watch or wearable device
- Walk away casually before mark notices

**Why It Works:**
- Standard class doesn't expect Unhoused to initiate friendly contact
- Physical contact creates distraction
- Wearable tech is valuable and easy to fence

**Scene Usage:**
- Background scam that Tyson and Gal might discuss

### Distraction Pickpocket

**How It Works:**
- One scammer creates distraction (loud argument, performance, "accident")
- While mark is watching, second scammer pickpockets them
- Could involve phone, wallet, small valuables
- Team splits up immediately after

**Why It Works:**
- Classic technique, still effective
- Works on all classes
- Quick and clean

**Scene Usage:**
- Scene 8: Adam uses chemistry fireball as distraction to pickpocket Tyson's phone (demonstration of Adam's skill)

### Found Watch Scam

**How It Works:**
- Scammer approaches with "found" watch (actually stolen earlier)
- Offers to sell it cheap to "help the mark" avoid it being lost forever
- Mark thinks they're getting valuable item for cheap
- Watch may be stolen, fake, or broken

**Why It Works:**
- Exploits mark's greed
- "Found" item seems like good deal
- Mark feels like they're helping by buying it

### ID Theft and Access Rental

**How It Works:**
- Steal Mid class ID (Red M marker)
- Can't withdraw money from victim's accounts (too traceable)
- Use ID temporarily for access to Mid-tier services (food, showers, medical care)
- Victim won't report it because altering/lending ID is illegal
- Return it quickly or discard before it's deactivated

**Advanced Version:**
- Offer to "upgrade" someone's Red M marker to Blue S
- Take their ID, promising to alter it
- Just steal the ID and use it for access
- Victim can't report because attempting to alter class markers is illegal
- Riskier because IDs are trackable

**Why It Works:**
- Mid class IDs grant access to better services than Unhoused can get
- Victims fear legal consequences of reporting
- Digital tracking means limited time window, but worth it for desperate Unhoused
- Can't take money, but can use for services

**Scene Usage:**
- Could be mentioned as risky scam Gal knows about
- Shows the desperation and creativity of Unhoused class

### Usage in the Story

**Character Roles:**
- **Tyson**: Young, agile, good at broken item scam and pickpocketing
- **Gal**: Experienced, knows ID theft scam, teaches Tyson refinement
- **Adam**: Chemistry skills allow unique distraction (fireball), skilled pickpocket

**Thematic Purpose:**
- Shows economic desperation of Unhoused class
- Demonstrates class tensions (preying on Standard and Mid classes)
- Adam's skills make him valuable to the community
- Bonding activity between Adam, Tyson, and Gal
- Contrast to Adam's "real job" disposing bodies (scams are petty in comparison)

**Class Dynamics:**
- Standard class are marks because of wealth and obliviousness
- Mid class less targeted (have less to steal)
- Unhoused class survival requires exploiting the system
- Police don't care about petty scams against Standard class
- Digital future makes paper scams obsolete but creates new opportunities

================================================================================

## 4. RE-ANIMATOR GAS

### The Problem

Adam needs a weapon to use against Geoff that can't be traced back to him and can bypass Moosk's protection. He turns to his chemistry knowledge to create a toxic gas that can kill Geoff silently and effectively.

### How It Works (Pseudo-Science)

**The Intended Function:**
- Toxic gas designed to be lethal through respiratory exposure
- Fast-acting - victim loses consciousness quickly, dies within minutes
- Glowing green "Reanimator" color
- Odor is pungent
- Heavier than air (sinks and pools, stays contained in enclosed spaces)
- Breaks down over time, leaving minimal trace evidence

**Adam's Approach:**
- Uses similar principles to his body disposal chemistry
- Combines compounds that react with biological tissues
- Designed to increased heart rate until heart attack
- Synthesized from materials he can acquire without raising suspicion
- Creates it in his secret lab using his chemistry expertise

**The Chemical Process:**
- The gas interferes with cells forcing energy output
- Death appears like cardiac arrest or respiratory failure

### The Flaw

**Unintended Side Effect - Re-animation:**
- The gas doesn't just kill - it causes cellular reactivation after death
- Heart starts pumping on its own
- Dead victims come back to life. They move like zombies toward other humans but they are braindead
- This is a slight drawback for Adam's purposes:
  - Creates unpredictable chaos
- Ultimately unsolved but gas still used in plan
- Adam is only one aware. Kills any victim Geoff uses it on so Geoff never realizes

**Why This Happens (Pseudo-Science):**
- The compounds that force cells to output energy don't stop working when the victim dies
- Dead cells continue to be stimulated by residual gas in the tissues
- The heart, being mostly muscle tissue, is particularly susceptible to continued stimulation
- The gas creates a feedback loop: dead cells release energy → heart pumps → blood flow brings the body to life
- The circulating blood delivers oxygen and nutrients to tissues, temporarily sustaining basic functions
- Similar to how electrical stimulation can make dead muscles contract, but on a systemic level
- Effect only works on bodies that died from the gas itself (gas must still be present in tissues)
- The reanimation continues until the gas breaks down or is fully metabolized

**Reanimated State:**
- Heart starts pumping again on its own
- Victims move like zombies - slow, uncoordinated movement toward other humans
- Completely braindead - no consciousness, memory, or rational thought
- Driven by residual autonomic nervous system activity (seeking warmth, movement, sound)
- No speech or recognition
- Movement continues until gas breaks down in the body or physical damage stops the heart
- Not truly alive - more like a biological automaton powered by chemical stimulation

**Adam's Strategy:**
- The gas works effectively as a killing tool
- The reanimation is a drawback but manageable
- Adam decides to use the gas anyway - he is out of time
- He keeps the reanimation flaw secret from Geoff
- When Geoff uses the gas on his victims, Adam makes sure to kill them again before Geoff realizes they reanimate
- This way Geoff never discovers the flaw and continues to trust the weapon
- Adam manages the secret carefully - it's leverage and insurance

### Adam's Creation Process

**Lab Work:**
- Conducted in his secret chamber over multiple nights
- Tests compounds on samples before creating the final formula
- Tests on a rat bought from Tracktown food store (discovers the reanimation effect here)
- The rat dies, then its heart starts beating again and it moves erratically
- Creates gas in pressurized container or delivery system
- Dangerous work - one mistake could kill Adam himself
- Spends additional time trying to remove the reanimation flaw but ultimately accepts it

**Inspiration:**
- Built on his knowledge of the acidic waste he uses for body disposal
- May have noticed unusual cellular activity in dissolved tissue
- Combines industrial chemicals with organic compounds
- References classic chemistry and possibly military chemical weapon theory
- Adam's background (possibly on the run from military) may explain his expertise

### Usage in the Story

**Adam Gives Geoff the Gas:**
- Adam provides the re-animator gas to Geoff as a weapon
- Presents it as a clean, effective killing tool
- Geoff uses it on his victims throughout Act 2
- Each time a victim reanimates, Adam is there to "clean up" - killing them again before they cause problems
- Geoff remains unaware of the reanimation flaw
- Adam maintains this deception as a form of control and insurance

**The Plan (Act 2/3):**
- Adam incorporates the gas into his plan to stop Geoff
- Knowing the reanimation effect, Adam can predict the chaos it will cause
- The gas serves multiple purposes:
  - Effective weapon
  - Creates confusion that Adam can exploit
  - Secret knowledge gives Adam an advantage
- Adam's control over this secret is part of his leverage against Geoff

**Narrative Function:**
- Shows Adam's desperation and scientific capabilities
- Creates a "Re-Animator" horror element (reference to the film)
- The glowing green gas visually echoes the Re-Animator aesthetic
- Demonstrates Adam's ability to manipulate Geoff despite power imbalance
- The reanimation adds body horror and dark comedy moments
- Raises stakes - Adam is working with dangerous, unpredictable weapons

**Potential Story Beats:**
- Scenes where Adam has to quickly kill reanimated victims before Geoff notices
- Tension as Adam nearly fails to cover up the reanimation
- Possible moment where Geoff discovers the flaw at a critical time
- The gas may play a role in the final confrontation or aftermath

================================================================================

## 5. BODY DISPOSAL SYSTEM

### The Secret Chamber

**Location:**
- Deep beneath the Tracktown settlement
- Accessed through Adam's network of crawlspaces
- Old industrial chamber from the railyard's operational days
- Possibly former maintenance vault, chemical storage, or utility room
- Below ground level in the swampy terrain (naturally hidden)

**Features:**
- Large enough to work in comfortably
- Connected to Adam's lab area
- Contains the acidic waste pool/container
- Ventilation to prevent toxic fume buildup
- Hidden entrance(s) that Adam keeps concealed
- Drainage connects to old industrial systems

### Acidic Waste Properties

**Appearance:**
- Glowing bright green (like the reagent in Re-Animator)
- Viscous, thick liquid
- Bioluminescent or chemiluminescent - provides its own eerie light
- Bubbling or slightly active surface
- Emits pungent chemical smell
- The same distinctive green color as the re-animator gas (visual connection)

**Function:**
- Dissolves organic matter rapidly
- Breaks down bone, tissue, clothing, everything
- Leaves no identifiable remains
- Process takes hours to fully dissolve a body
- Creates heat during dissolution (exothermic reaction)

**Origin:**
- May be industrial waste Adam discovered or collected
- Could be something Adam synthesized/enhanced using chemistry
- Possibly connected to old railyard industrial processes
- Adam has been accumulating it over time
- Limited supply - reason Adam worries about running out of space

**Storage Problem:**
- Adam is running out of room to store the waste (mentioned in Act 2)
- Can't just dump it - too dangerous and identifiable
- Visiting the spot too often increases risk of discovery
- May be toxic to local environment (swamp ecology)

### Adam's Lab

**Equipment:**
- Chemistry glassware (beakers, flasks, condensers)
- Burners and heating equipment
- Storage for chemicals and compounds
- Possibly refrigeration for certain materials
- Basic safety equipment (though limited)
- Notes, formulas, calculations written/posted
- Shelving for supplies

**How He Got It:**
- Stolen from various sources over time, previous job
- Salvaged from industrial sites
- Some items improvised from household materials
- Represents significant investment of time and money

**Adam's Background:**
- Chemistry knowledge suggests formal education or training
- Possibly military background (mentioned as "on the run from military")
- Could be former scientist, researcher, or military chemist
- Homelessness may be result of fleeing his past
- Skills are both his salvation and his curse

### Disposal Process

**Step 1 - Transport:**
- Adam moves body through crawlspaces to the secret chamber
- Must avoid detection by other Tracktown residents
- Uses darkness and knowledge of patrol patterns
- Bodies wrapped/concealed during transport

**Step 2 - Preparation:**
- Removes any items that won't dissolve (metal, synthetic materials)
- May need to process body further for faster dissolution
- Places body into acidic waste

**Step 3 - Dissolution:**
- Body dissolves over several hours
- Adam may wait or return later to check progress
- Ensures complete dissolution (no bones or tissue remaining)
- Manages waste levels and containment

**Step 4 - Clean-Up:**
- Disposes of any non-dissolved materials separately
- Cleans tools and area
- Conceals entrance and removes evidence of activity
- Returns to surface and maintains normal appearance

================================================================================

## 6. GEOFF'S TECHNOLOGY

### Robot Bodyguard (Moosk)

**Appearance:**
- Humanoid robot
- Size and build suggest intimidation and combat capability
- May have visible mechanical elements or appear mostly human-like
- Silent or minimal speech
- Movements are precise, efficient, inhuman

**Capabilities:**
- Superhuman strength
- Combat programming
- Threat assessment and protection protocols
- May have weapons integrated into body
- Possibly surveillance/recording equipment
- Networked with Geoff's other technology

**Function in Story:**
- Enforces Geoff's will
- Protects Geoff from threats
- Intimidates witnesses and victims
- Participates in murders (may do the actual killing)
- Symbol of Geoff's wealth and technological advantage

### The Robot Double

**The Reveal (Act 3, Scene 23):**
- Adam shoots what he thinks is Geoff's head off
- It's a robot - the "Geoff" he shot was a duplicate
- Real Geoff emerges unharmed

**How It Works:**
- Robot designed to look and act exactly like Geoff
- May be indistinguishable from real Geoff in appearance
- Could be Geoff remotely controlling the robot
- Or autonomous AI mimicking Geoff's behavior
- Allows Geoff to be in dangerous situations without risk

**Why Geoff Uses It:**
- Protection from assassination attempts
- Maintains public presence while staying safe
- Can be in multiple places at once
- Demonstrates his paranoia and resources
- Ultimate symbol of his untouchability

### Drone Fleet

**Description:**
- Small-to-medium aerial drones
- Multiple units deployed simultaneously
- Marked with Amazing Company's smiley face logo
- Equipped with gas dispersal systems
- Autonomous or remotely controlled

**Gas Deployment System:**
- Releases gas from canisters mounted on drones
- Can cover large area quickly
- Precise control over dispersal pattern
- Creates a fenced-off kill zone
- Designed for mass extermination

### Amazing Company

**Geoff's Corporation:**
- Major corporation with public profile
- Smiley face logo (cheerful, corporate, sinister irony)
- Enough power to control police and media
- Resources to develop military-grade technology
- Public image management is ongoing subplot

**Technology Level:**
- Advanced robotics (Moosk, the double)
- Drone swarms
- Surveillance systems
- Chemical weapons
- Suggests near-future setting where billionaires control military tech

================================================================================

## WRITING NOTES

**Tone and Genre:**
- Sci-fi horror with dark comedy elements
- References: Breaking Bad (chemistry), Re-Animator (gas), Street Trash (toxic waste aesthetic)
- Balance horror of situation with absurd/comedic "how will he get out of it" situations
- Geoff's titter laugh undercuts tension with unsettling wrongness

**Visual Style:**
- Tracktown should feel lived-in and real, not post-apocalyptic
- The vertical stacking of train cars creates unique visual signature
- Contrast bright toxic waste glow with dark, grimy environments
- Swampy setting adds atmosphere and practical obstacles

**Thematic Elements:**
- Economic disparity (homeless expected, billionaires untouchable)
- Rebirth and second chances (Adam's arc, re-animator gas)
- Community vs. isolation (Adam finding belonging, then losing it)
- The impossibility of escaping systemic power (Geoff always wins)

**Adam's Character:**
- Highly intelligent, chemically skilled
- Withdrawn due to past trauma (military background?)
- Capable of terrible things but seeking redemption
- Arc: isolation → community → loss → choice
- His skills are both survival tool and curse

**Key Dramatic Questions:**
- Can Adam escape Geoff's control?
- Will he sacrifice himself for his community?
- What is his final choice in Scene 27?
- Does the re-animator gas play a role in the ending?
