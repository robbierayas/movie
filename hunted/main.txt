# Hunted

## Logline
A serial killer approaching 30 wants something more challenging for his birthday—after reading "The Most Dangerous Game," he targets a survivalist he spots at Cabela's, but the man's family proves deadlier than expected.

## Synopsis
Liam, a 29-year-old bartender approaching 30, has killed before—easy targets, nobodies, kills that proved nothing. For his 30th birthday, he wants a real challenge. After reading "The Most Dangerous Game," he becomes obsessed with hunting worthy prey. At a Cabela's, he spots Hank—a man clearly comfortable with survival gear, knowledgeable, confident. Liam follows him to a large property and discovers the perfect target: a suburban prepper, head of household, someone who might actually fight back.

Liam stalks Hank for weeks, going through their mail, learning their routines. When the family leaves, Liam makes his move—flattening Hank's car tire down the block to isolate him. But Hank spots something wrong and the hunt begins outside. Hank fights back across his own property before the battle moves inside. Liam notices the family's hunting awards—these people hunt. After a grueling battle, Liam finally kills Hank.

The family returns early. The youngest runs toward the front door. Liam grabs them hostage to escape. Sarah sees Hank's body through the window—knows he's dead. She confronts Liam: "If you ever come back, you're dead." He replies: "I already got what I came for." She responds: "Then I'll have to come for you." Liam releases the child and escapes. He doesn't care about witnesses—not getting caught is just another challenge.

Sarah investigates on her own, without police. We see an unbiased view of Liam—the bartender job, his invisible life. She gets close to identifying him, but he goes off the grid. She loses the trail, but prepares the house anyway. She knows he'll come back.

With her children, Sarah transforms their home into a death trap. The 18-year-old shares her obsession. The younger two (12 and 10) grow scared.

When Liam returns, he walks into a nightmare. Sarah and the 18-year-old—both consumed by revenge—hunt him through the trap-laden house. The 18-year-old dies during the battle.

In the final confrontation, Sarah sends the two younger children to "finish him" while she holds Liam off. But the 12-year-old grabs their younger sibling, slips out, and calls 911.

Liam catches Sarah. While torturing her, he activates one of her traps—now both are wounded, disabled. They have a brutal, crawling struggle. Liam kills her. As he staggers toward escape, police cars surround the property. The two younger children saved themselves by doing the sensible thing. Liam is caught—not by survivalist ingenuity, but by a phone call.

## Theme
The hunter becomes the hunted—but revenge consumes as much as it protects. Sometimes the sensible choice beats the dramatic one.

## Genre
Thriller / Horror / Cat-and-Mouse

## Setting
**Present-day large American city (Houston, Atlanta, or similar) with suburban/semi-urban residential areas.**

The story moves between:
- **Liam's world**: Cramped apartment, bartending job where he's invisible to customers, Cabela's and outdoor stores—urban anonymity where a killer can hide in plain sight
- **The family home**: A large plot in a semi-suburban area, partially prepped—solar panels, reinforced doors, basement supplies, workshop. Family hunting awards displayed inside. Appears normal from outside but contains Hank's survivalist modifications
- **The transformed home**: After Hank's death, the same house becomes a fortress of improvised traps and defensive positions

## Characters

### Liam - FICTIONAL
29, turning 30. Bartender with no college degree, invisible to everyone. But Liam has a secret: he's killed twice before.

**Kill 1:** Unseen, referenced only by trophy—a hair bow he keeps hidden.

**Kill 2:** Shown via voiceover/flashback in Act 1. While working a shift, a friendly regular customer he doesn't really know is joined by others who crack a joke at Liam's expense. He takes it the wrong way—sees it as humiliation. Later that night, he spots someone who looks like that guy. Hunts him down, kills him, keeps his glasses as a trophy. While storing the glasses, we glimpse the bow from Kill 1.

Liam thinks he's skilled because he's kept it secret. After the second kill, he finishes reading "The Most Dangerous Game" and the idea takes hold: he wants a real challenge. Not a hacker—goes through mail and observes in person to gather info. Meticulous planner but emotionally volatile when things go wrong.

**Voiceover:** Liam narrates all of Act 1. Voiceover continues through stalking Hank (gives family overview, explains what he learns from their mail). Ends with "Let's do this" as he approaches the house to start the hunt.

### Hank Reeves - FICTIONAL
Early 40s. Prepper and homesteader at heart despite living on a large semi-suburban property. Ex-blue collar, now works remote IT. Teaches his family self-sufficiency—gardening, canning, basic carpentry, home defense. Family has hunting awards. Not paranoid, just prepared. When Liam flattens his tire and forces him to walk home, Hank spots something wrong before reaching the house. The fight begins outside on his own territory—he's a formidable opponent who nearly wins. His death is hard-earned.

### Sarah Reeves - FICTIONAL
Late 30s. Practical, grounded, initially skeptical of Hank's prepper lifestyle but learned the skills to support him. Hank's death transforms her—grief channeled into cold determination. Her face-to-face moment with Liam awakens something primal. She becomes the leader of the family's defensive preparation. Tragically, her obsession with revenge blinds her to simpler solutions—she dies because she chose to fight when her children chose to call for help.

### The Children - FICTIONAL
Three children:
- **Oldest (18)** - [Gender TBD]. Goes all-in on revenge with Sarah. Shares her obsession, helps with the most dangerous traps. Dies in Act 3 alongside their mother's cause.
- **Middle (12)** - The practical one. Participates in preparation but grows increasingly scared. Makes the 911 call that saves themselves and their younger sibling.
- **Youngest (10)** - Follows the 12-year-old's lead. Escapes with them when they leave to call police.

The 18-year-old's death alongside Sarah reinforces the tragedy of revenge. The younger two survive because they choose the sensible option.

## STORY STRUCTURE

### ACT ONE: The Predator
**Theme:** A killer wants to level up

**[LIAM VOICEOVER THROUGHOUT ACT 1]**

Liam's mundane existence masks his secret: he's killed before. Via voiceover, he reflects on his second kill: working a shift at the bar, a friendly regular he doesn't really know is joined by others who crack a joke at Liam's expense. He takes it wrong—humiliation. Later that night, he spots someone who looks like the guy. Hunts him down. Keeps his glasses. While storing them, we glimpse a hair bow—trophy from his first kill (unseen, unexplained).

After the reflection, Liam explains he finished reading "The Most Dangerous Game." The idea takes hold: he wants a real challenge. Someone who can fight back.

At a Cabela's, Liam spots Hank—a man clearly in his element among survival gear, knowledgeable, confident. Liam follows him to the parking lot, gets his license plate, tracks him to the large property.

**[VOICEOVER CONTINUES through surveillance]** - Liam narrates his observations. Goes through their mail (not a hacker). Gives family overview: wife Sarah, three kids, Hank's prepper lifestyle. Learns their schedules, routines, the layout of the property. Notes the hunting awards displayed in the house.

**Major Beats:**
- Liam's mundane bartending life (voiceover begins)
- Flashback: bar scene while working, the joke, the humiliation
- Flashback: hunting down look-alike, keeping glasses
- Storing glasses, glimpse of hair bow trophy
- Voiceover: finishing "The Most Dangerous Game," getting the idea
- The Cabela's encounter—spotting Hank
- Following Hank home, beginning surveillance
- Going through mail, learning about the family (voiceover continues)
- Observing family routines, noting hunting awards
- Planning the attack

**Act One Climax:** Liam watches the family leave. Voiceover ends with "Let's do this." He approaches the house.

---

### ACT TWO: The Hunt
**Theme:** The prey fights back

**PART 1: THE FIGHT**

Hank isn't home yet. Liam's plan: flatten Hank's car tire just down the block, forcing him to walk back alone. It works—Hank starts walking home on foot.

But Hank spots something wrong before reaching the house. The hunt begins outside, across the large property. Hank fights back immediately—this is his territory. Liam chases him toward the house, and the battle moves inside.

Liam notices the hunting awards on the walls—this family hunts. Hank uses everything: tools, furniture, his knowledge of the home's layout. Liam is injured, frustrated, realizes he underestimated his target. The fight is ugly, desperate, nothing like the elegant hunt Liam imagined. This is what he wanted—but it's almost too much.

Finally, Liam wins—but it's messy, exhausting, and he's wounded. Before he can collect himself, headlights. The family is home early.

The youngest runs toward the front door. Liam grabs them—takes them hostage to escape before the rest of the family can get inside. Sarah sees Hank's body through the window. Knows he's dead. Just trying to protect the kids now.

**The exchange:**
- Sarah: "If you ever come back, you're dead."
- Liam: "I already got what I came for."
- Sarah: "Then I'll have to come for you."

Liam releases the youngest and escapes. He doesn't care about witnesses—this is just another challenge. Not getting caught is part of the game.

**PART 2: SARAH'S INVESTIGATION**

Sarah doesn't go to the police. She investigates on her own. We see an **unbiased explanation of Liam**—not from his POV. Who he really is: the bartender job, his invisible life, hints of his past (but not the kills—those stay hidden). Sarah pieces together clues, gets close to identifying him.

But Liam goes off the grid. Disappears. Sarah loses the trail.

**Major Beats:**
- Liam flattens Hank's tire down the block
- Hank walks home, spots something wrong
- Chase/fight begins outside on the property
- Battle moves inside the house
- Liam notices hunting awards
- Hank's near-victories and Liam's desperate counters
- Hank's death
- Family returns, youngest runs to door
- Liam takes youngest hostage to escape
- Face-to-face exchange with Sarah
- Liam escapes, releases hostage
- Sarah's solo investigation (unbiased view of Liam)
- Sarah gets close, but Liam goes off the grid

**Act Two Climax:** Sarah has lost Liam's trail. But she's prepared the house. She knows he'll come back—for the challenge, not to silence witnesses. She's ready.

---

### ACT THREE: The Hunted
**Theme:** Prey becomes predator—but revenge has a cost

Parallel preparation. Liam heals, plans his return, learns from his mistakes. Sarah transforms the house—Hank's prepper supplies become materials for traps. The 18-year-old is all-in, shares Sarah's obsession, helps with the most dangerous setups. The two younger children (12 and 10) participate but grow increasingly scared—this has gone beyond defense into something darker.

Police investigation runs in background but provides no protection. Sarah knows Liam will come back. She's counting on it.

When Liam returns for the "easy" cleanup kills, he walks into a prepared battlefield. The final act inverts the structure—now Liam is the one being hunted through the house. Each trap, each ambush, uses skills Hank taught his family.

The 18-year-old dies during the battle—committed to revenge like their mother, killed for it.

In the climax, Sarah confronts Liam directly. She sends the two younger children to "finish him off" while she holds him. But the 12-year-old—seeing what revenge cost their older sibling and mother—makes the practical choice: they grab the 10-year-old, slip out of the house, and call 911.

Meanwhile, Liam catches Sarah. While torturing her, he accidentally activates one of her traps—now both are wounded, disabled. They have a brutal, crawling struggle with each other, both broken. Liam kills her.

Exhausted, wounded, Liam staggers toward escape—and finds police cars surrounding the property. The two younger children watch from a safe distance as Liam is arrested.

**Major Beats:**
- Liam's recovery and planning
- Sarah's preparation montage (18-year-old all-in, younger two scared)
- Liam's return and first trap
- Running battle through the modified house
- 18-year-old's death (committed to revenge, killed for it)
- Final confrontation: Sarah vs. Liam
- 12-year-old's choice: grab younger sibling, escape, call 911 (result shown, not the call)
- Liam catches Sarah, activates trap while torturing her
- Disabled struggle—both wounded, crawling, fighting
- Liam kills Sarah
- Liam caught by police while escaping

**The Irony:** Sarah and the 18-year-old's survivalist approach—the traps, the preparation, the direct confrontation—gets them both killed. The younger children survive by rejecting that approach and simply calling for help. The killer is caught not by ingenuity but by a 911 call.

## KEY STORY ELEMENTS

### The Most Dangerous Game
Liam reads the classic short story (not watches the film). The story about hunting humans as the ultimate sport speaks to his need for a real challenge after his previous "easy" kills. He sees himself as Count Zaroff—an aristocrat of murder, above common killers. He doesn't realize Zaroff loses in the end.

### The Prepper House
Hank's home is stocked for societal collapse—non-perishable food, water filtration, tools, first aid, defensive supplies. After his death, these materials become the building blocks for the family's defensive transformation. The house we saw as a normal suburban home reveals hidden depths.

### The Cabela's Encounter
Liam spots Hank at Cabela's—a man comfortable with survival gear, knowledgeable, confident. This chance encounter sets the whole story in motion. Liam recognizes a "worthy" target and follows him home.

### The Face-to-Face Moment
Liam takes the youngest hostage to escape. Sarah sees Hank's body through the window—knows he's dead. The exchange:
- "If you ever come back, you're dead."
- "I already got what I came for."
- "Then I'll have to come for you."
Liam releases the child and escapes. He doesn't care about witnesses—not getting caught is part of the game. Sarah's threat is just another challenge.

### Sarah's Investigation
After the attack, Sarah investigates without police. We shift to an **unbiased view of Liam**—not his self-aggrandizing voiceover, but who he really is: invisible bartender, cramped apartment, pathetic life. Sarah pieces together clues, gets close. But Liam goes off the grid. She loses the trail—but prepares anyway.

### The Children's Choice
The ironic climax. The 18-year-old shares Sarah's obsession and dies for it. Sarah sends the two younger children to "finish" Liam—but the 12-year-old grabs their younger sibling and makes the practical choice: leave the house and call 911 (we only see the result—cops arriving). They survive because they choose the sensible option. Sarah and the 18-year-old die because they couldn't.

### The Traps
[TBD - specific traps to be designed. Should use realistic prepper/homesteader materials and knowledge. Reference "Home Alone" for ingenuity but with lethal intent and consequences.]

---

## DRAMATIC THEMES

1. **Hunter vs. Hunted** - The central reversal that drives the story
2. **The Cost of Revenge** - Sarah's obsession with killing Liam herself gets her killed
3. **Practicality vs. Drama** - The children survive by choosing the unglamorous option (call 911)
4. **Preparation Meets Crisis** - Hank's prepping proves both useful and insufficient
5. **Grief as Consumption** - Sarah's grief transforms from strength to fatal obsession
6. **Underestimation** - Liam underestimates Hank, then underestimates the whole family
7. **Legacy** - Hank's true legacy: children practical enough to know when to get help
8. **Irony** - The survivalist approach fails; a phone call succeeds

---

## PRODUCTION NOTES

**Visual Style:**
- Dual perspective cinematography: Kyle's POV feels predatory, stalking; family POV feels intimate, domestic
- The house transforms visually between acts—normal home, then battleground, then trap-house
- Night/darkness in final act contrasts with daylight normalcy of act one
- Film references: The Most Dangerous Game, Straw Dogs, You're Next, Home Alone (dark version)

**Tone Notes:**
- Cat-and-mouse throughout with shifting power dynamics
- Violence should be visceral and have consequences (injuries matter, exhaustion matters)
- Liam is pathetic but genuinely dangerous—not a cartoon villain
- Sarah's transformation should feel earned, then tragic as it consumes her
- The ending should feel ironic but not mocking—Sarah's death is a tragedy, not a punchline

---

## TIMELINE

**Estimated Runtime:** 100-120 minutes

**Act Breakdown:**
- Act One: 25-30 minutes (Liam's life, discovery, surveillance, approach)

- Act Three: 35-40 minutes (Preparation, Liam's return, final confrontation)

---

## NOTES FOR DEVELOPMENT

- The traps in Act 3 need to be specific, practical, and visually interesting
- 18-year-old's gender and name TBD
- 12-year-old and 10-year-old names TBD
- Aftermath/coda TBD (children with relatives? news coverage?)
