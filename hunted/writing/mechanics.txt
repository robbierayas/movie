HUNTED - STORY MECHANICS
========================================

This file addresses potential plot holes and audience questions about
legal issues, weapon choices, and tactical decisions.


HOUSE LAYOUT - THE CASTLE
-------------------------

The house is secretly designed to imitate medieval castle defensive principles.
Hank's prepper mindset informed every design choice.

### Overall Structure
- 2 stories + attic + basement
- 200+ feet of open ground in all directions (the "kill zone")
- Scattered shrubs and trees provide concealment but no real cover
- No neighboring structures within sight
- Isolated location - deliberate

### Exterior Defense (The Killing Field)
- Open ground forces any attacker to cross 200+ ft exposed
- From upper floors, defenders can see anyone approaching
- Shrubs/trees break up sight lines but don't provide cover from above
- No vehicles can approach without being heard/seen

### First Floor - The Outer Ward
- Open floor plan for quick defense and retreat
- Minimal furniture/obstacles - clear sight lines
- All paths funnel toward main stairwell
- Purpose: slow attackers, inflict damage, fall back to stairs
- NOT meant to be held - just to bleed the attacker

### Main Stairwell - The Gatehouse
- Single main staircase (other access points can be blocked/trapped)
- Top of stairs = primary defensive choke point
- Narrow approach favors defenders above
- Castle equivalent: the gatehouse

### Second Floor - The Inner Ward
- Castle-style layout: tighter corridors, more choke points
- Rooms:
  - Master bedroom + master bathroom
  - 3 additional bedrooms
  - 1 bathroom
- Narrow hallways favor defenders
- Multiple corners and doorways for ambush
- One bedroom closet contains ladder to attic

### Attic - The Keep
- Final defensive position / last stand
- The "keep" - where you hold until death or rescue
- Contains supplies for extended holdout
- Access: ladder in bedroom closet (can be pulled up/blocked)
- Contains SECRET PASSAGE to basement

### Secret Passage
- Hidden passage from attic to secret basement room
- Passage goes BOTH WAYS (can climb up or down)
- Castle equivalent: the sally port / secret tunnel

### Basement
- Regular room contains sporting equipment + WEAPONS
- Guns, crossbows, hunting gear stored here
- More guns than police seized (Hank's backups)

### Secret Basement Room - The Larder
- Hidden behind secret wall in main basement
- Secret door looks like regular wall (Hank's craftsmanship)
- Prepper food storage - supplies for extended siege
- NO weapons stored here (just food/supplies)
- Basement exit: [TBD - bulkhead? window?]

### Fire Resistance
- House built to withstand fire (like a stone castle)
- First floor can burn and house remains standing
- Siege mentality: built to outlast, not to abandon

### Windows
- 2nd story windows too high for safe escape
- Castle logic: keep attackers OUT, not escape FROM

### Design Philosophy
- Every element forces attackers into disadvantageous positions
- Defenders always have retreat options (within the house)
- Attackers always have to push forward into unknown
- House itself is the weapon
- Hank built this knowing someday it might be needed


BOOBY TRAP LEGALITY
-------------------

### The Problem
Booby traps are illegal in all 50 US states. Setting a trap that could
harm someone - even an intruder - is typically a felony. Victims of
booby traps can sue the homeowner, and homeowners can face criminal
charges including manslaughter or murder if someone dies.

The legal principle: You can't use deadly force against a theoretical
future intruder. Self-defense requires an imminent threat.

### Sarah's Loophole

Liam's explicit threat creates a legal gray area:

1. **Documented Threat**
   - Liam said "I'll visit soon" directly to Sarah
   - This is a clear, specific, credible threat of future violence
   - He already murdered Hank - demonstrates capability and intent
   - Sarah can argue she had reasonable belief of imminent danger

2. **Police Report (if filed)**
   - Even if Sarah doesn't fully cooperate with police investigation
   - A report documenting the threat exists
   - Creates paper trail of the danger

3. **Castle Doctrine / Stand Your Ground**
   - Most states have strong home defense laws
   - Texas, Florida, Georgia, etc. favor homeowners
   - Setting: Houston/Atlanta area - favorable legal environment
   - No duty to retreat in your own home

4. **The "Imminence" Argument**
   - Traditional self-defense requires imminent threat
   - But: threat was specific ("I'll visit soon")
   - Attacker demonstrated lethal intent (killed Hank)
   - Attacker knows their location (already found them once)
   - Sarah can argue threat was ongoing and imminent

5. **Practical Reality**
   - If Sarah survives, she's a sympathetic figure
   - Jury would likely side with grieving widow defending children
   - Prosecutor unlikely to charge aggressively
   - Dead intruder can't sue

### Story Function
- Sarah briefly acknowledges the legal risk
- Maybe one line: "If we're wrong about this, we go to prison."
- But her obsession overrides caution
- The younger kids' fear partly stems from this - they know it's wrong

### Note for Screenplay
Don't over-explain. A brief acknowledgment is enough. Audiences will
accept the premise if you don't draw too much attention to it.


WHY NOT JUST USE GUNS?
----------------------

### The Problem
Hank is a prepper. The family has hunting awards. They clearly own guns.
Why doesn't Sarah just wait with a shotgun and shoot Liam when he enters?

This is the #1 question audiences will ask. Must be addressed.

### The Solution (Two Parts)

**Part 1: Guns Were Seized as Evidence**

The night of Hank's murder:
- Liam kills Hank using a different method (knife, blunt force, strangulation)
- During the struggle or after, Liam fires Hank's gun (why? intimidation,
  to draw attention, or just chaotic moment)
- Sarah fires her gun at Liam during the hostage escape
- Multiple shots fired = police seize ALL firearms as evidence
- Standard procedure: ballistics testing, chain of custody, investigation
- Sarah can't get them back during active investigation
- "They took everything. Every gun in the house. Said it was evidence."

This is simple, believable, and requires minimal explanation.

**Part 2: Liam Wears Armor**

Even if Sarah had a gun, Liam prepared for it:
- Liam expects a prepper family to be armed
- He returns wearing body armor / ballistic vest
- Visible when he enters - audience sees he came prepared
- Reinforces that he's not stupid, just arrogant
- Traps work because they target areas armor doesn't cover
- Also makes him scarier - he's thought this through

This subverts the "just shoot him" solution twice:
1. She doesn't have guns (seized)
2. Even if she did, he's armored

### Story Function
- The gun seizure is addressed in Act 2, Scene 10 (preparing the house)
- Sarah's frustration: "They took everything. We have nothing."
- Eli: "We have the house. We have what Dad taught us."
- Liam's armor revealed in Act 3, Scene 12 (the return)
- Audience realizes guns wouldn't have worked anyway
- Validates the trap strategy


LIAM'S RETURN LOGIC
-------------------

### The Problem
Why does Liam come back? He got his "hunt." Why risk it?

### The Answer (Already in main.txt)
- Liam doesn't care about witnesses
- Not getting caught is part of the challenge
- Sarah's threat ("I'll come for you") is another challenge
- His ego demands he "win" against her too
- He underestimates them - thinks it'll be easy cleanup

### Reinforce in Screenplay
- Liam's voiceover in Act 1 establishes his need for challenge
- His healing montage in Act 3 shows him planning, anticipating
- He's excited, not scared - this is what he lives for
- His arrogance is his downfall


WHY DOESN'T SARAH CALL POLICE?
------------------------------

### The Problem
Normal person would call 911, let police handle it.

### The Answers

1. **She DID call police (after Hank's death)**
   - They investigated, took evidence, have no leads
   - Liam went off the grid - can't find him
   - Police aren't providing protection
   - "They said call if he shows up again. He'll kill us before they arrive."

2. **Sarah Has a Grudge with Police (Work History)**
   - Sarah's occupation involved negative experience with law enforcement
   - Possible backgrounds:
     - Former public defender - saw police lie, lose evidence, let people walk
     - Social worker - saw system fail families repeatedly
     - Journalist who covered police misconduct
     - Victim advocate who watched cases fall apart
   - She's seen firsthand how people escape justice
   - Deep distrust: "I've seen what happens when you trust them to handle it."

3. **She Doesn't Trust Them to Hold Liam**
   - Even if police catch him, she's seen people get out
   - Bail, technicalities, plea deals, early release
   - Liam is smart, no prior record (never caught), good lawyer could help him
   - "He'll get 10 years, serve 4, and come back for us."
   - She needs him DEAD, not arrested
   - Only way to be sure is to do it herself

4. **Revenge + Certainty**
   - It's not just about revenge (though that's part of it)
   - It's about making sure he can NEVER come back
   - Police = uncertainty. Her traps = certainty.
   - "I won't spend the rest of my life waiting for him to find us again."

### Story Function
- Sarah's distrust of police should be established in Act 2
- Brief reference to her work history - don't over-explain
- "You know what I saw every day at work? People like him getting out."
- The 12-year-old (Emma) calling 911 is the IRONIC ENDING
- The sensible choice that Sarah rejected
- The system Sarah didn't trust actually WORKS - Liam is caught
- If Sarah had just let police handle it, she'd be alive
- Her distrust was her tragic flaw


TRAP EFFECTIVENESS
------------------

### The Problem
If traps are so effective, why doesn't everyone use them?

### The Answer
- Traps are effective against UNPREPARED intruders
- Liam is prepared for a fight, just not THIS fight
- He expects guns, direct confrontation
- He doesn't expect the house to be the weapon
- First trap shocks him, subsequent traps hurt him
- He adapts but is already wounded
- Traps work because of SURPRISE and PREPARATION

### Note
- Some traps should fail or be avoided
- Liam should disarm or bypass several
- This makes the ones that work more satisfying
- Also shows he's smart - just not smart enough


THE TRAP THAT GETS THEM BOTH
----------------------------

### Setup
In Act 3, Scene 15, a trap wounds both Sarah and Liam, leading to the
crawling struggle.

### Requirements
- Must be a trap Sarah set
- Must be triggerable by accident during struggle
- Must disable both of them similarly
- Allows for brutal, even fight to the death

### Possibilities

1. **Pit Trap / Floor Collapse**
   - Fighting near weakened floor
   - Both fall through into basement
   - Both injured from fall
   - Crawling fight in basement

2. **Blade/Spike Trap Crossfire**
   - Trap triggers, hits both
   - Each takes shrapnel/blade damage
   - Both bleeding, disabled

3. **Electrified Floor**
   - Liam forces Sarah onto trap
   - But he's touching her - both shocked
   - Both temporarily paralyzed, then crawling

4. **Spring-Loaded Weapon**
   - Triggers during struggle
   - Impales or injures both
   - Pinned together or near each other

5. **Chemical/Fire Trap**
   - Accelerant ignites
   - Both burned, trying to escape
   - Fire adds urgency to crawling struggle

### Recommended
Floor collapse or pit trap - most visually interesting, creates new
environment for final fight, easy to understand, both clearly disabled.

### Story Application
- Eli (18) could have Senior division awards from YHEC or SASP
- Emma (12) and Olivia (10) could have NASP archery awards from school
- Hank likely coached/mentored them through these programs
- Explains family's comfort with weapons and tactical thinking
- Awards visible in house = worldbuilding detail


POLICE RESPONSE TIME
--------------------

### The Problem
Emma calls 911. How long until police arrive?

### The Answer
- Rural/semi-suburban property - response time 10-15 minutes
- Long enough for final crawling struggle
- Long enough for Liam to kill Sarah
- Short enough that he can't escape before they arrive

### Sequence
1. Emma and Olivia escape, run to neighbor or safe distance
2. 911 call made (we don't see it, just result)
3. Inside: Liam catches Sarah, torture begins
4. Trap triggers, both disabled
5. Crawling struggle (5-10 minutes of story time)
6. Liam kills Sarah
7. Liam tries to escape
8. Police arrive - 10-15 minutes after call
9. Liam arrested

### Note
Don't specify exact times in screenplay. Let audience feel the tension
without checking their watches.
