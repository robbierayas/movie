HUNTED - STORY MECHANICS
========================================

This file addresses potential plot holes and audience questions about
legal issues, weapon choices, and tactical decisions.


HOUSE LAYOUT - THE CASTLE
-------------------------

The house is secretly designed to imitate medieval castle defensive principles.
Hank's prepper mindset informed every design choice.

### Overall Structure
- 2 stories + attic + basement
- 200+ feet of open ground in all directions (the "kill zone")
- Scattered shrubs and trees provide concealment but no real cover
- No neighboring structures within sight
- Isolated location - deliberate

### Exterior Defense (The Killing Field)
- Open ground forces any attacker to cross 200+ ft exposed
- From upper floors, defenders can see anyone approaching
- Shrubs/trees break up sight lines but don't provide cover from above
- No vehicles can approach without being heard/seen

### First Floor - The Outer Ward

**Exterior Structure:**
- Square footprint with covered porch wrapping all the way around
- Porch has stone supports/foundation
- Stone construction allows house to remain standing even if first floor interior burns
- Front door (main entrance) and back door (kitchen exit)

**Corner Sunrooms (4 total, one at each corner):**
- Small rectangular rooms, approximately 8ft x 8ft each
- Windows on exterior walls have emergency shutters (can seal rooms)
- Two interior walls per sunroom, each with large center door
- Doors have 270-degree range of motion
- Door positioning allows sunroom doors to swing out and block front/back doors
- Function: corner strongpoints that can isolate/block main entrances

**Main Rooms:**

        [BACK OF HOUSE]

SR = Sunroom (corner)
```

- **Foyer**: Entry from front door, connects to living room and stairs
- **Living Room**: West side of house, open archway to central area (no door)
- **Kitchen**: East side of house, open archway to central area (no door)
- **Pantry**: By back door, storage area
- **Fireplace/Chimney**: Central location, conceals secret passage to all floors

**Note**: Living room and kitchen have archways, not doors - keeps sight lines open across the first floor.

**Secret Passage Access:**
- Fireplace chimney on first floor hides entrance to secret passage
- Passage runs vertically through all floors (basement to attic)
- Accessible from each level

**Tactical Purpose:**
- Open floor plan allows quick defense and retreat
- Sunroom doors can seal off entrances (trap attackers or block pursuit)
- All paths funnel toward main stairwell
- NOT meant to be held - bleed the attacker, then fall back to stairs
- Emergency shutters allow selective room isolation

### Main Stairwell - The Gatehouse
- Single main staircase (other access points can be blocked/trapped)
- Top of stairs = primary defensive choke point
- Narrow approach favors defenders above
- Castle equivalent: the gatehouse

**The Gatehouse Doors:**
- Metal-reinforced double doors at top of stairs
- Cannot be broken down by force
- Transom windows above doors for air circulation
- Transom glass is bulletproof - can see through but can't shoot through
- When sealed, second floor becomes impenetrable from stairs

### Second Floor - The Inner Ward
- Castle-style layout: tighter corridors, more choke points
- Rooms:
  - Master bedroom + master bathroom
  - 3 additional bedrooms
  - 1 bathroom
- Narrow hallways favor defenders
- Multiple corners and doorways for ambush
- One bedroom closet contains ladder to attic

### Attic - The Keep
- Final defensive position / last stand
- The "keep" - where you hold until death or rescue
- Contains supplies for extended holdout
- Access: ladder in bedroom closet (can be pulled up/blocked)
- Contains SECRET PASSAGE to basement

### Secret Passage
- Hidden inside the fireplace chimney structure
- Runs vertically through ALL floors: basement → first floor → second floor → attic
- Access points concealed at each level (behind false panels/bricks)
- Passage goes BOTH WAYS (can climb up or down)
- Castle equivalent: the sally port / secret tunnel
- Hank's craftsmanship makes it undetectable to outsiders

### Basement
- Regular room contains sporting equipment + WEAPONS
- Guns, crossbows, hunting gear stored here
- More guns than police seized (Hank's backups)

### Secret Basement Room - The Larder
- Hidden behind secret wall in main basement
- Secret door looks like regular wall (Hank's craftsmanship)
- Prepper food storage - supplies for extended siege
- NO weapons stored here (just food/supplies)
- Basement exit: [TBD - bulkhead? window?]

### Fire Resistance
- House built to withstand fire (like a stone castle)
- First floor can burn and house remains standing
- Siege mentality: built to outlast, not to abandon

### Windows
- 2nd story windows too high for safe escape
- Castle logic: keep attackers OUT, not escape FROM

### Design Philosophy
- Every element forces attackers into disadvantageous positions
- Defenders always have retreat options (within the house)
- Attackers always have to push forward into unknown
- House itself is the weapon
- Hank built this knowing someday it might be needed


BOOBY TRAP LEGALITY
-------------------

### The Problem
Booby traps are illegal in all 50 US states. Setting a trap that could
harm someone - even an intruder - is typically a felony. Victims of
booby traps can sue the homeowner, and homeowners can face criminal
charges including manslaughter or murder if someone dies.

The legal principle: You can't use deadly force against a theoretical
future intruder. Self-defense requires an imminent threat.

### Sarah's Loophole

Liam's explicit threat creates a legal gray area:

1. **Documented Threat**
   - Liam said "I'll visit soon" directly to Sarah
   - This is a clear, specific, credible threat of future violence
   - He already murdered Hank - demonstrates capability and intent
   - Sarah can argue she had reasonable belief of imminent danger

2. **Police Report (if filed)**
   - Even if Sarah doesn't fully cooperate with police investigation
   - A report documenting the threat exists
   - Creates paper trail of the danger

3. **Castle Doctrine / Stand Your Ground**
   - Most states have strong home defense laws
   - Texas, Florida, Georgia, etc. favor homeowners
   - Setting: Houston/Atlanta area - favorable legal environment
   - No duty to retreat in your own home

4. **The "Imminence" Argument**
   - Traditional self-defense requires imminent threat
   - But: threat was specific ("I'll visit soon")
   - Attacker demonstrated lethal intent (killed Hank)
   - Attacker knows their location (already found them once)
   - Sarah can argue threat was ongoing and imminent

5. **Practical Reality**
   - If Sarah survives, she's a sympathetic figure
   - Jury would likely side with grieving widow defending children
   - Prosecutor unlikely to charge aggressively
   - Dead intruder can't sue

### Story Function
- Sarah briefly acknowledges the legal risk
- Maybe one line: "If we're wrong about this, we go to prison."
- But her obsession overrides caution
- The younger kids' fear partly stems from this - they know it's wrong

### Note for Screenplay
Don't over-explain. A brief acknowledgment is enough. Audiences will
accept the premise if you don't draw too much attention to it.


WHY NOT JUST USE GUNS?
----------------------

### The Problem
Hank is a prepper. The family has hunting awards. They clearly own guns.
Why doesn't Sarah just wait with a shotgun and shoot Liam when he enters?

This is the #1 question audiences will ask. Must be addressed.

### The Solution (Two Parts)

**Part 1: Guns Were Seized as Evidence**

The night of Hank's murder:
- Liam kills Hank using a different method (knife, blunt force, strangulation)
- During the struggle or after, Liam fires Hank's gun (why? intimidation,
  to draw attention, or just chaotic moment)
- Sarah fires her gun at Liam during the hostage escape
- Multiple shots fired = police seize ALL firearms as evidence
- Standard procedure: ballistics testing, chain of custody, investigation
- Sarah can't get them back during active investigation
- "They took everything. Every gun in the house. Said it was evidence."

This is simple, believable, and requires minimal explanation.

**Part 2: Liam Wears Armor**

Even if Sarah had a gun, Liam prepared for it:
- Liam expects a prepper family to be armed
- He returns wearing body armor / ballistic vest
- Visible when he enters - audience sees he came prepared
- Reinforces that he's not completely stupid, just arrogant
- Traps work because they target areas armor doesn't cover or he removed it from burns
- Also makes him scarier - he's thought this through

This subverts the "just shoot him" solution twice:
1. She doesn't have guns (seized)
2. Even if she did, he's armored

### Story Function
- The gun seizure is addressed in Act 2, Scene 10 (preparing the house)
- Sarah's frustration: "They took everything. We have nothing."
- Eli: "We have the house. We have what Dad taught us."
- Liam's armor revealed in Act 3, Scene 12 (the return)
- Audience realizes guns wouldn't have worked anyway
- Validates the trap strategy


LIAM'S ARMOR
------------

### Design Philosophy
Liam studied medieval armor - specifically how plate and mail combined to
deflect arrows, swords, and lances. His version is homemade and updated
for modern threats: bullets and knives. Like a knight's harness, he had
to make trade-offs between protection and mobility.

His approach: protect the vitals from bullets, accept some knife
vulnerability at joints for movement, keep weight manageable for
extended combat.

### Construction Method
- Small metal plates (~3 inches x 2 inches each)
- Hard metal - could be steel, titanium scrap, or armor plate offcuts
- Plates SEWN together onto a backing (leather or heavy fabric)
- Overlapping like fish scales for flexibility while maintaining coverage
- DIY aesthetic - visible stitching, uneven edges, clearly homemade
- Function over form - ugly but effective

### Coverage Areas

**Torso (Front and Back):**
- Full plate coverage from collarbone to waist
- Heaviest concentration of plates
- Designed to stop handgun rounds and knife stabs
- Allows bending at waist due to scale construction

**Shoulders:**
- Light shoulder pads as base (sports equipment)
- Metal plates sewn onto the pads
- Provides coverage but doesn't restrict arm movement
- Gaps at the actual shoulder joint for mobility

**Upper Arms:**
- Plate coverage on outer/front of bicep area
- Inner arm has less coverage (needs to bend)
- Attached to shoulder pieces or separate sleeves

**Lower Arms (Forearms):**
- Plate coverage on outer forearm
- Inner forearm lighter for wrist flexibility
- Protects against defensive wounds (blocking strikes)

**Upper Legs (Thighs):**
- Plates on front and outer thigh
- Inner thigh minimal (needs to walk/run)
- Attached to belt or sewn into pants

**Lower Legs (Shins):**
- Plate coverage on front of shin
- Calf area lighter
- Must not interfere with ankle flexion

### Helmet
- Base: DIRTBIKE HELMET with sun visor (not welding helmet - too dark)
- Visor can flip up for better visibility in low light
- Metal plates DRILLED around the helmet exterior
- Covers top, sides, and back of head
- Chin bar provides some face protection
- Face shield is polycarbonate, not metal (needs to see)

### Hands
- CHAINMAIL construction on front and back of hand
- Small rings linked together (could be DIY from wire or salvaged)
- FINGERS are just leather - needs dexterity to grip weapons, use tools
- Wrist area connects to forearm plates
- Trade-off: hand protection vs. finger mobility

### Feet
- 3 metal plates per shoe
- Top of foot, outer ankle area, shin extension
- Heel and sole unarmored (needs to walk normally)
- Likely attached to sturdy boots

### WEAK SPOTS (Critical for Fight Choreography)

1. **Front of Neck/Throat**
   - No plate coverage here - would restrict head movement
   - Vulnerable to thrusts, slashes, choking
   - Sarah's knife finds this target in stairwell fight

2. **Eyes/Face**
   - Visor is polycarbonate, not bulletproof
   - Can be smashed, cracked, or flipped up
   - Flashbang effectiveness goes through visor
   - Direct face strikes still hurt

3. **Fingers**
   - Only leather protection
   - Can be cut, broken, damaged
   - Losing finger function affects weapon grip

4. **Joint Gaps (Armpits, Inner Elbow, Back of Knee)**
   - Where plates meet, there are gaps for movement
   - Vulnerable to stabbing attacks from specific angles
   - Difficult to hit in combat but possible

5. **Inner Thighs/Groin**
   - Minimal plate coverage for mobility
   - Femoral artery accessible
   - Sarah's slash catches his thigh in Scene 13

6. **Areas Where Armor is Removed**
   - Burns from fire traps damage plates
   - He removes armor pieces as they become liabilities
   - Hot metal against skin vs. exposed vulnerability
   - Each fire trap potentially creates new weak spots

### Mobility Trade-offs
- Full medieval armor weighed 45-55 lbs
- Liam's version probably 25-35 lbs (less coverage, modern materials)
- Still causes fatigue over extended fight
- Heat buildup inside (exhaustion factor)
- Limits some movements (can't do full crouch, restricted reaching)
- Running possible but slower than unarmored

### What It Stops
- Handgun rounds (9mm, .45) - absorbed by torso plates
- Crossbow bolts - deflected or stopped (Scene 13, bolt hits chest plate)
- Knife slashes to covered areas - plates prevent penetration
- Blunt impacts - distributed across plate surface

### What Gets Through
- Rifle rounds (if family had access)
- Sustained fire to same spot (plates can crack/deform)
- Attacks to weak spots listed above
- Fire/heat (conducts through metal, burns underneath)
- Attacks that target AFTER armor is damaged/removed

### Story Function
- Explains why crossbow bolt doesn't penetrate (Scene 13)
- Justifies why shooting through floor doesn't kill him (Scene 13)
- Creates specific targets for Sarah in fights (neck, thighs)
- Fire traps become strategic - damage armor, create openings
- Progressive armor loss tracks accumulated damage
- By final fight, he's lost significant protection to burns


LIAM'S RETURN LOGIC
-------------------

### The Problem
Why does Liam come back? He got his "hunt." Why risk it?

### The Answer (Already in main.txt)
- Liam doesn't care about witnesses
- Not getting caught is part of the challenge
- Sarah's threat ("I'll come for you") is another challenge
- His ego demands he "win" against her too
- He underestimates them - thinks it'll be easy cleanup

### Reinforce in Screenplay
- Liam's voiceover in Act 1 establishes his need for challenge
- His healing montage in Act 3 shows him planning, anticipating
- He's excited, not scared - this is what he lives for
- His arrogance is his downfall


WHY DOESN'T SARAH CALL POLICE?
------------------------------

### The Problem
Normal person would call 911, let police handle it.

### The Answers

1. **She DID call police (after Hank's death)**
   - They investigated, took evidence, have no leads
   - Liam went off the grid - can't find him
   - Police aren't providing protection
   - "They said call if he shows up again. He'll kill us before they arrive."

2. **Sarah Has a Grudge with Police (Work History)**
   - Sarah's occupation involved negative experience with law enforcement
   - Possible backgrounds:
     - Former public defender - saw police lie, lose evidence, let people walk
     - Social worker - saw system fail families repeatedly
     - Journalist who covered police misconduct
     - Victim advocate who watched cases fall apart
   - She's seen firsthand how people escape justice
   - Deep distrust: "I've seen what happens when you trust them to handle it."

3. **She Doesn't Trust Them to Hold Liam**
   - Even if police catch him, she's seen people get out
   - Bail, technicalities, plea deals, early release
   - Liam is smart, no prior record (never caught), good lawyer could help him
   - "He'll get 10 years, serve 4, and come back for us."
   - She needs him DEAD, not arrested
   - Only way to be sure is to do it herself

4. **Revenge + Certainty**
   - It's not just about revenge (though that's part of it)
   - It's about making sure he can NEVER come back
   - Police = uncertainty. Her traps = certainty.
   - "I won't spend the rest of my life waiting for him to find us again."

### Story Function
- Sarah's distrust of police should be established in Act 2
- Brief reference to her work history - don't over-explain
- "You know what I saw every day at work? People like him getting out."
- The 12-year-old (Emma) calling 911 is the IRONIC ENDING
- The sensible choice that Sarah rejected
- The system Sarah didn't trust actually WORKS - Liam is caught
- If Sarah had just let police handle it, she'd be alive
- Her distrust was her tragic flaw


TRAP EFFECTIVENESS
------------------

### The Problem
If traps are so effective, why doesn't everyone use them?

### The Answer
- Traps are effective against UNPREPARED intruders
- Liam is prepared for a fight, just not THIS fight
- He expects guns, direct confrontation
- He doesn't expect the house to be the weapon
- First trap shocks him, subsequent traps hurt him
- He adapts but is already wounded
- Traps work because of SURPRISE and PREPARATION

### Note
- Some traps should fail or be avoided
- Liam should disarm or bypass several
- This makes the ones that work more satisfying
- Also shows he's smart - just not smart enough


THE TRAP THAT GETS THEM BOTH
----------------------------

### Setup
In Act 3, Scene 15, a trap wounds both Sarah and Liam, leading to the
crawling struggle.

### Requirements
- Must be a trap Sarah set
- Must be triggerable by accident during struggle
- Must disable both of them similarly
- Allows for brutal, even fight to the death

### Possibilities

1. **Pit Trap / Floor Collapse**
   - Fighting near weakened floor
   - Both fall through into basement
   - Both injured from fall
   - Crawling fight in basement

2. **Blade/Spike Trap Crossfire**
   - Trap triggers, hits both
   - Each takes shrapnel/blade damage
   - Both bleeding, disabled

3. **Electrified Floor**
   - Liam forces Sarah onto trap
   - But he's touching her - both shocked
   - Both temporarily paralyzed, then crawling

4. **Spring-Loaded Weapon**
   - Triggers during struggle
   - Impales or injures both
   - Pinned together or near each other

5. **Chemical/Fire Trap**
   - Accelerant ignites
   - Both burned, trying to escape
   - Fire adds urgency to crawling struggle

### Recommended
Floor collapse or pit trap - most visually interesting, creates new
environment for final fight, easy to understand, both clearly disabled.


YOUTH HUNTING/SHOOTING COMPETITIONS
------------------------------------

  - Wildlife Identification
  - Orienteering
  - Hunter Safety Trail
  - Hunter Responsibility Exam
- Local → State → National competition structure
- Emphasizes practical hunting skills and safety
- Website: yhec.nra.org

### 2. National Archery in Schools Program (NASP)

### Story Application
- Eli (18) could have Senior division awards from YHEC or SASP
- Emma (12) and Olivia (10) could have NASP archery awards from school
- Hank likely coached/mentored them through these programs
- Explains family's comfort with weapons and tactical thinking
- Awards visible in house = worldbuilding detail


POLICE RESPONSE TIME
--------------------

### The Problem
Emma calls 911. How long until police arrive?

### The Answer
- Rural/semi-suburban property - response time 10-15 minutes
- Long enough for final crawling struggle
- Long enough for Liam to kill Sarah
- Short enough that he can't escape before they arrive

### Sequence
1. Emma and Olivia escape, run to neighbor or safe distance
2. 911 call made (we don't see it, just result)
3. Inside: Liam catches Sarah, torture begins
4. Trap triggers, both disabled
5. Crawling struggle (5-10 minutes of story time)
6. Liam kills Sarah
7. Liam tries to escape
8. Police arrive - 10-15 minutes after call
9. Liam arrested

### Note
Don't specify exact times in screenplay. Let audience feel the tension
without checking their watches.
