## PROJECT OVERVIEW

A thriller/horror film about a serial killer who targets a survivalist for his 30th birthday challenge, but the man's family proves deadlier than expected. When the killer returns, the hunter becomes the hunted—but revenge consumes as much as it protects.

**Logline:** A serial killer approaching 30 wants something more challenging for his birthday—after reading "The Most Dangerous Game," he targets a survivalist he spots at Cabela's, but the man's family proves deadlier than expected.

**Theme:** The hunter becomes the hunted—but revenge has a cost. Sometimes the sensible choice beats the dramatic one.

## STORY STRUCTURE

## KEY STORY ELEMENTS

### Voiceover Structure
- **Act 1**: Liam narrates throughout—self-aggrandizing, delusional
- **Act 2 onward**: No voiceover—Liam seen objectively as pathetic

### The Inversion
- Act 2: Liam hunts Hank (Liam as predator)
- Act 3: Family hunts Liam (Liam as prey)

### The Irony
Sarah and Eli's survivalist approach gets them killed. Emma and Olivia survive by calling 911. The sensible choice beats the dramatic one.

## CHARACTER VOICE NOTES

### Liam
- V.O. is formal, pseudo-intellectual, self-aggrandizing
- Does NOT directly explain his motivations
- Frames murder casually as "a little game"
- Minimal spoken dialogue—performative when speaking

### Hank
- Big personality, booming voice
- Folksy wisdom, secure masculinity
- Natural storyteller

### Sarah
- Brief and practical in Act 1
- Cold and threatening after Hank's death
- Commands become tactical

### Bobby
- Crass and unfiltered with Hank
- Code-switches to quiet/polite around family
