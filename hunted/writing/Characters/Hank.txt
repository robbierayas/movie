## KEY SCENES
- **Act 1, Scene 3: The Cabela's Encounter** - First appearance. Demonstrates expertise at Cabela's with friend Bobby—knowledgeable about emergency rations, prefers knives over guns close-quarters: "Knife doesn't jam. Doesn't run out of ammo. Doesn't make noise." Unknowingly marks himself as Liam's target.
- **Act 2, Scene 6: The Flat Tire** - Recognizes sabotage instantly. Dodges arrows, uses flashbang. Hand impaled on nail trap, loses gun. Headbutts Liam, kicks him off porch. Gets inside despite severe hand wound. Proves he's formidable.
- **Act 2, Scene 7: The Battle Inside** - Final stand. Uses blackbelt tourniquet and sai. Nearly wins multiple times—disarms Liam, dominates with skill—but wounded hand and Liam's dirty fighting overcome him. Stabbed with table leg. Last words: "My family. They're not part of this." Dies protecting them even in death.
