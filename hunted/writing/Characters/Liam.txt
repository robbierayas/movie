## KEY SCENES
- **Act 1, Scene 1: The Humiliation** - Liam bartends invisibly while his V.O. reveals self-aggrandizing worldview ("I possess so much skill"). A customer's casual joke about poisoning drinks triggers his shift from self-pity to cold calculation: "People who get all the luck don't realize they have no skill."
- **Act 1, Scene 2: Bar Revenge** - Liam stalks and kills a look-alike victim, revealing this is his second kill. Trophy box contains glasses and a child's hair bow. After reading "The Most Dangerous Game," he realizes random victims offer no challenge: "The only prey worth hunting is prey that can hunt you back."
- **Act 1, Scene 3: The Cabela's Encounter** - Liam hunts for worthy prey at Cabela's, dismissing unworthy targets. Spots Hank demonstrating survival expertise. Brief interaction: "Just... learning." Follows Hank home, noting his isolation: "The knife man lives out here. Isolated. Thinks he's safe. Perfect."
- **Act 1, Scene 4: The Surveillance (Montage)** - Weeks of reconnaissance. Learns the family, routines, property layout. Notes Hank's hunting trophies: "So he does hunt. The liar." Plans to catch Hank outside: "Time to hunt."
- **Act 1, Scene 5: Let's Do This** - Family leaves. Liam gears up (knife, rope, bear mace). Watches Hank arrive home alone. Final V.O.: "He's good. Maybe even great. But I'm better... Let's do this." VOICEOVER ENDS.
- **Act 2, Scene 6: The Flat Tire** - First real engagement. Slashed tire, arrows, nail trap in handrail. Gets nose broken by Hank's headbutt, kicked off porch. "Oh, you're good..." Hank escapes inside. Liam hurls objects through windows: "We're just getting started!"
- **Act 2, Scene 7: The Battle Inside** - Brutal indoor fight. Disarmed by Hank's sai, forced to use furniture and dirty tricks. "This wasn't supposed to be this hard." Stabs Hank with broken table leg. "Good game... You were [the challenge]." Executes Hank with his own gun. Headlights arrive—family returning.
- **Act 2, Scene 8: The Hostage** - Takes Olivia hostage to escape. "I already got what I came for." Sarah threatens him; he's intrigued: "I'd like that." Maces the room and flees.
- **Act 2, Scene 9: Sarah's Investigation** - Seen objectively for first time—pathetic apartment, murder wall. Bumps into Sarah/Eli leaving. Nearly caught—tackled, hit with lamp—but escapes via fire escape. Writes "CYA SOON" on car window. The hunt continues.
