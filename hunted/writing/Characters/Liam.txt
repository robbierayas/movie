## CHARACTER FUNCTION
The antagonist. A serial killer who wants to "level up" by hunting worthy prey. Drives the entire narrative through his obsession with challenge.

## PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION
[Physical appearance, distinctive features - to be determined from screenplay]

## PERSONALITY TRAITS
- Invisible to everyone in daily life
- Views himself as skilled/elite despite mundane existence
- Takes offense easily - interprets jokes as humiliation
- Meticulous planner (goes through mail, observes in person)
- Emotionally volatile when things go wrong
- Sees not getting caught as "just another challenge"
- Self-aggrandizing (compares himself to Count Zaroff)

## RELATIONSHIPS
- Regular customers: invisible to them, resents them
- Hank Reeves: sees as "worthy prey" - formidable opponent
- Sarah Reeves: adversary, respects as another challenge
- The children: collateral, not targets

## CHARACTER ARC
- **Beginning State (Act 1)**: Invisible bartender with grandiose self-image, has killed before but finds "unworthy" victims unsatisfying. Seeks a real challenge to prove his self-proclaimed skill.
- **Inciting Incident**: Humiliation at the bar triggers his decision to hunt "worthy prey" - someone who can fight back.
- **Escalation (Act 2)**: Finds Hank, stalks him, launches attack. Wins the fight but barely - Hank nearly kills him multiple times. Wounded, he escapes but faces an unexpected new opponent: Sarah.
- **Crisis Point (Act 3)**: Returns armored and prepared, but the family's traps wound him severely. Kills Eli but Sarah nearly kills him. Both are caught in the final trap.
- **End State**: Dies in suicide-by-cop wearing Hank's blackbelt as a trophy. Got the challenge he wanted - and it consumed him. A Negative Arc: his obsession with proving his "skill" leads to his destruction.

## DIALOGUE STYLE
- Voiceover throughout Act 1 - self-aggrandizing, views himself as skilled
- V.O. uses formal, pseudo-intellectual language ("unlocked chasms," "possess so much skill") that masks narcissistic grandiosity as objective self-assessment
- Consistently reframes failures as external forces ("took a shit on me," "got screwed") - never accepts personal responsibility
- Shifts abruptly from self-pitying to coldly calculating when humiliated
- V.O. tone is clinical and detached even when discussing grievances
- Does NOT directly explain his motivations - never says "I do this because..." or connects his violence to his insecurities out loud. His delusion keeps him from that level of self-awareness.
- Frames murder casually as "a little game" - playful, almost bored tone about killing
- Uses dismissive labels for victims ("this chump," "regular asshat") - dehumanizing language
- Contemptuous when speaking directly to victims: "Does everyone think skill can be bought?"
- Literary pretension - references Zaroff, sees himself as cultured predator rather than common criminal
- Victim-blaming worldview: "They just have luck. Bad luck." - victims deserve it for lacking skill
- Minimal spoken dialogue - when he does speak, it's performative ("Just... learning."), playing a role to blend in
