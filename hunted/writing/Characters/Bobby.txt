# BOBBY

## BASIC INFORMATION
- **Full Name**: Bobby (last name TBD)
- **Age**: Early 40s (same as Hank)
- **Occupation**: Construction (works with Hank sometimes)
- **Family**: Single

## ARCHETYPE
**The Buddy / The Sacrifice** - Hank's longtime friend and hunting companion. Provides contrast to Hank's capability. Arrives to help in Act 3 and dies trying.

## CHARACTER FUNCTION
Establishes Hank's social world and provides someone for Hank to interact with naturally. His "pray and spray" gun preference contrasts with Hank's knife expertise, highlighting what makes Hank special. Returns in Act 3 as cavalry that fails—reinforces that outside help can't save the family; they must save themselves (or call 911).

## PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION
- Typical neckbeard - unkempt facial hair
- Always wearing camo, even when unnecessary
- Smokes and drinks beer
- Softer build than Hank - less physically capable

## PERSONALITY TRAITS
- Talkative and crass with Hank - his full unfiltered self
- Quiet and polite around Hank's family - knows his personality would be off-putting to them
- Enthusiastic about guns, hunting, guy stuff
- Not as skilled or knowledgeable as Hank but tries to keep up
- Good-natured, not mean-spirited

## RELATIONSHIPS
- Hank: longtime friend, hunting buddy, coworker - one of the few people he can fully be himself around
- Sarah/kids: respectful, keeps his rougher edges hidden
- Liam: saw him at Cabela's, never formally met, killed by him

## CHARACTER ARC
- **Beginning State (Act 1)**: Hank's buddy, admires but can't match his friend's skills and family life. The "pray and spray" guy—relies on firepower over finesse.
- **Acts 2-3**: Not present during Hank's murder. Returns in Act 3 when the girls call him.
- **Crisis Point (Scene 15)**: Arrives to help, finds Girly seemingly dead. Goes hunting with her one last time. Dies in the basement—burned on the stairs before he can fire a shot.
- **End State**: Dies trying to help his friend's family. His "pray and spray" shotgun never gets used. The irony Liam noted at Cabela's proves tragically accurate.

## DIALOGUE STYLE
- Crass and unfiltered with Hank - swears, makes crude jokes ("No shit?", "That's some fortune cookie shit")
- Code-switches to polite and quiet around the family
- Enthusiastic about things he likes - "Oh hell yes", "Now we're talking"
- Uses hunter/gun slang naturally ("pray and spray")
- Teases Hank back affectionately ("Mister Karate Man")
- Self-deprecating about his own skills vs Hank's
- Sincere admiration slips through the banter ("You make it look easy", "I don't know how you do it")

## KEY SCENES
- **Act 1, Scene 3: The Cabela's Encounter** - Shopping with Hank at Cabela's. Enthusiastic about tactical shotgun: "Pray and spray, baby." Gets teased by Hank about being less skilled with knives. Unknowingly part of Liam's target selection process.
- **Act 1, Scene 4: Family Time** - Code-switches to family-friendly mode. Plays with Girly ("Who's the best gorilla?"), gets used as Hank's comedic demonstration of "how not to fight." Taps out dramatically for the kids' entertainment. Uncle Bobby figure—rough edges hidden.
- **Act 3, Scene 15: Bobby's Return** - Arrives after girls call. Finds Girly seemingly dead, she wakes up. They hunt together one last time—the rhythm from dozens of hunts. Burned on basement stairs before he can fire a shot. "Spray and pray. Neither one helped." Dies trying to help his friend's family.
