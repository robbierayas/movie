## FULL SCRIPT

INT. REEVES HOUSE - SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT

Smoke seeps up through the floorboards. The first floor crackles and pops below.

Sarah gathers the family in the hallway. ELI paces, crossbow ready. EMMA holds OLIVIA close.

                    SARAH
          We're safe up here. He can't get past the oil trap, and the stairs are the only way up.

                    ELI
          He went to the basement. He's looking for another way.

                    SARAH
          There isn't one. We just have to wait.

Eli, frustrated.

                    ELI
          Wait? He killed Dad. He's down there right now, and you want to WAIT?

Emma, quietly.

                    EMMA
          Maybe we should just go. Out the window.

                    OLIVIA
          The drone—

                    EMMA
          We could break the glass. Run fast.

                    SARAH
          No. We finish this. Here.

Emma's face falls. This is what she was afraid of.

INT. REEVES HOUSE - BASEMENT - NIGHT

Liam searches through the darkness. Flashlight in one hand, knife in the other.

He finds the WEAPON STORAGE. Most of it empty—Sarah took what she needed.

But there's a SHOTGUN hidden behind a shelf. He checks it. Two shells.

Liam smiles.

                    LIAM
          Amateurs.

He moves deeper into the basement. Searching.

INT. REEVES HOUSE - SECOND FLOOR - NIGHT

Olivia stares at the window. The DRONE hovers outside, red light blinking.

Olivia turns to Emma.

                    OLIVIA
          It can't shoot through the glass.

                    EMMA
          What?

                    OLIVIA
          The drone. The BBs. They bounced off the window. It can only shoot if we open it.

Emma looks at the drone. Back at Olivia. The girl is right.

                    EMMA
          Mom—

But Sarah and Eli are arguing near the stairs. Not listening.

                    ELI
          I'm not hiding up here while he crawls around down there!

                    SARAH
          You go down there, you die. Just like—

She stops herself. But they both know what she almost said.

Eli, cold.

                    ELI
          I'm not Dad.

He moves toward the stairs.

                    SARAH
          Eli. ELI!

But he's already going down, crossbow raised.

Sarah hesitates—torn between following him and protecting the girls.

Sarah turns to Emma.

                    SARAH
          Stay here. Don't move.

She follows Eli.

INT. REEVES HOUSE - FIRST FLOOR - NIGHT

Fire has spread to half the first floor. Orange light flickers through the smoke. Heat presses against exposed skin. Visibility near zero.

Eli descends through the haze. Crossbow raised. Eyes searching the chaos.

Sarah follows. Reaching for him. Trying to pull him back.

                    ELI
          Come on! You wanted a hunt? HERE I AM!

His voice echoes through the burning house. Challenging. Reckless.

Sarah, hissing.

                    SARAH
          Eli, stop—

A SHOTGUN BLAST.

The sound is deafening. Muzzle flash cuts through the smoke.

Eli is thrown backward. Pellets SHRED his shoulder. His arm. The crossbow spins away into the flames.

He hits the floor. Slides. Comes to rest against the wall.

Liam emerges from the smoke like a demon. Shotgun raised. Eyes wild in the firelight.

He found Bobby's gun.

Sarah SCREAMS. She charges at him. No weapon. Just rage.

Liam pivots. Fires the second barrel.

Sarah dives. Hits the floor. Pellets TEAR through the air where her head was. Punch holes in the wall behind her.

She's down. Winded. Ears ringing.

Liam tosses the empty shotgun aside. It clatters into the flames.

He draws his KNIFE. The same one that killed Hank.

Eli, gasping, trying to rise. Blood pouring from his shoulder. His left arm won't move—tendons severed, bone shattered.

But he's trying. Still trying.

                    ELI
          Mom... run...

Liam walks to him. Slow. Deliberate. No rush now.

He stands over the wounded boy. Looks down at him.

                    LIAM
          The one who wouldn't let me leave.

He crouches beside Eli. Close enough to see the fear in the boy's eyes. The defiance under the fear.

                    LIAM
          "Two men enter, one man leaves." That what you said?

Eli musters what's left. Gathers bloody saliva. Spits.

It misses Liam's face. Lands on his boot.

Liam's expression doesn't change.

                    LIAM
          Brave kid.

He drives the knife into Eli's chest. Below the sternum. Angled up.

The boy's body jerks. His eyes go wide.

A sound escapes him—not quite a scream. Air leaving damaged lungs.

Liam twists the blade. Then pulls it free.

Eli shudders once. Twice.

Goes still.

Sarah watches from the floor. Smoke stinging her eyes. Or maybe it's tears.

Her oldest child. Her son.

Dead.

Sarah, broken whisper.

                    SARAH
          No...

Liam stands. Wipes the blade on Eli's shirt.

                    LIAM
          Not even worth the effort.

He turns toward Sarah—

She's already moving. Running. Up the stairs.

INT. REEVES HOUSE - SECOND FLOOR - NIGHT

Sarah bursts onto the second floor, tears streaming.

                    EMMA
          Mom? Where's Eli?

Sarah can't answer. She grabs Emma's arm, pulls her toward the bedroom.

                    SARAH
          Attic. Now. Both of you. NOW!

Olivia sees her mother's face. Understands.

Olivia, small voice.

                    OLIVIA
          Eli...?

Sarah pushes them toward the closet with the attic ladder.

                    SARAH
          GO!

Emma and Olivia scramble up the ladder. Sarah follows—

Heavy footsteps on the stairs. Liam is coming.

INT. REEVES HOUSE - SECOND FLOOR - CONTINUOUS

Emma reaches back down to help Olivia up. Sarah is right behind—

A hand grabs her ankle. Liam. He pulls.

Sarah kicks. Catches him in the face. He lets go.

She's up. Into the attic. She pulls the ladder up behind her.

INT. REEVES HOUSE - ATTIC - CONTINUOUS

Dark. Cramped. Emergency supplies stacked against the walls.

Sarah, Emma, and Olivia huddle in the darkness.

Below, Liam POUNDS on the attic hatch.

                    LIAM (O.S.)
          Open up, Sarah. Let's finish this.

Sarah presses a hand over Olivia's mouth. The girl is crying silently.

EXT. REEVES HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Smoke pours from the lower windows. Fire glows behind broken glass.

LIAM'S DRONE still hovers. Watching. Waiting.

But inside, Liam has made a decision.

INT. REEVES HOUSE - SECOND FLOOR - CONTINUOUS

Liam stops pounding. Steps back.

Looks at the window.

He walks to it. Looks out at the exterior wall. The roof.

Liam turns to himself.

                    LIAM
          Fine. We'll do it the hard way.

He smashes the window. The drone backs away, recognizing its master.

Liam climbs out onto the exterior wall. Begins pulling himself toward the attic window.

INT. REEVES HOUSE - ATTIC - CONTINUOUS

Sarah hears the window break. The silence that follows.

Emma, whispering.

                    EMMA
          What's he doing?

Sarah's eyes go to the attic window. Small. Dirty. Overlooking the roof.

                    SARAH
          He's coming from outside.

She looks at her daughters. Makes a decision.

                    SARAH
          The passage. Go. Now.

                    EMMA
          What about you?

                    SARAH
          I'll hold him off. You two get out. Run to the neighbors. Call the police.

                    EMMA
          Mom—

Sarah, fierce.

                    SARAH
          This ends one way or another. But you two are getting out. GO.

She pushes them toward the SECRET PASSAGE entrance—hidden behind a false wall panel.

Emma hesitates. Looks at her mother one last time.

Then she takes Olivia's hand and disappears into the passage.

Sarah turns to face the attic window.

And waits.
