## FULL SCRIPT

EXT. REEVES PROPERTY - NIGHT

Liam crosses the open ground. Confident. WELDING HELMET tucked under his arm. MAKESHIFT ARMOR visible beneath his jacket.
DRONE controller in one hand. TASER in the other.

He's halfway across the yard when—

BARKING. Loud. Aggressive.

Girly charges from the side of the house. Eighty pounds of Rottweiler, teeth bared.

Liam doesn't flinch. Waits.

The dog launches—

Liam sidesteps, jams the TASER into her neck.

CRACK.

Girly yelps. Convulses. Drops to the grass, twitching.

Liam looks down at her. No emotion.

Liam, quietly.

                    LIAM
          Good dog.

He steps over her body. Continues toward the house.

He spots the security camera on the porch. Looks directly into it.

Smiles.

He pulls on the welding helmet.

INT. REEVES HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Sarah watches him approach on a laptop screen—security feed.

                    SARAH
          Positions. Now.

Eli grabs his crossbow. Moves to the second floor. EMMA and OLIVIA huddle near the stairs, ready to retreat.

EXT. REEVES HOUSE - FRONT PORCH - NIGHT

Liam reaches the door. Tests the handle. Locked.

He takes a step back. KICKS.

The door SPLINTERS inward—

The MOLOTOV TRAP triggers. Glass shatters. Fire ERUPTS.

Liam stumbles back, arm raised. Flames lick his jacket. He pats them out.

Liam laughs.

                    LIAM
          Nice try.

INT. REEVES HOUSE - FOYER - CONTINUOUS

Liam enters through the burning doorway. The first floor is dim. Smoke drifting.

He moves toward the living room—

SECONDARY DOORS SLAM SHUT around him. Mechanical. Rigged to close from multiple triggers.

He's sealed in the foyer.

                    LIAM
          What the—

A FLASHBANG drops from above. Through a gap in the ceiling.

BANG.

Liam staggers, helmet ringing. Half-blind.

GUNSHOTS from the second floor. Sarah fires through the floor—bullets punching through wood.

Liam drops flat. Bullets spark off his armor. One grazes his leg.

Liam, growling.

                    LIAM
          Body armor, bitch!

He crawls toward a door. Kicks it. It doesn't budge—reinforced.

INT. REEVES HOUSE - SECOND FLOOR - CONTINUOUS

Sarah reloads. Eli readies the crossbow.

                    ELI
          Did we get him?

                    SARAH
          Not yet.

She listens. Movement below.

                    SARAH
          Fall back. Stairs.

They retreat to the stairwell position. Emma and Olivia move higher.

INT. REEVES HOUSE - FOYER - CONTINUOUS

Liam finds a weakness in a door. Shoulder-charges it. Once. Twice.

It BREAKS.

He's through. Reaches the bottom of the stairs.

Looks up.

Eli stands at the top, crossbow raised.

Eli FIRES.

The bolt THUNKS into Liam's armored chest. Doesn't penetrate, but the impact staggers him.

Liam rips the bolt out. Starts up the stairs.

Sarah appears beside Eli. She has a HUNTING KNIFE.

                    SARAH
          Go!

Eli hesitates—

                    SARAH
          GO!

Eli retreats. Sarah descends to meet Liam halfway.

INT. REEVES HOUSE - STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS

They clash on the stairs. Knife against fists.

Sarah's faster. She slices his forearm. His thigh. Blood sprays.

But Liam's stronger. He catches her wrist. SQUEEZES.

She cries out. The knife clatters down the stairs.

Liam throws her. She tumbles, catches herself on the banister.

He advances—

CLICK.

Sarah triggers something. A TRIP WIRE at her ankle.

The MOLOTOV TRAP at the door—a SECOND ONE—ignites. Fire races up the wall. Catches Liam's leg.

He SCREAMS. Beats at the flames. His pant leg burns.

                    LIAM
          YOU FUCKING—

Sarah scrambles up the stairs. The family retreats to the second floor.

FIRE spreads across the first floor. The house is starting to burn.

INT. REEVES HOUSE - SECOND FLOOR - CONTINUOUS

The family clusters near a window. Emma tries to open it.

EXT. REEVES HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

The DRONE lifts off from where Liam left it. Rises to window level.

The small weapon attachment FIRES. BBs pepper the window frame.

INT. REEVES HOUSE - SECOND FLOOR - CONTINUOUS

Emma screams, ducking back.

                    EMMA
          There's something out there!

Sarah looks. Sees the drone hovering.

                    SARAH
          He's got a drone. We can't go out that way.

Olivia, crying.

                    OLIVIA
          What do we do?

Below, Liam's voice echoes up the stairwell—

                    LIAM (O.S.)
          HOW DARE YOU BURN ME!

Heavy footsteps on the stairs. He's coming.

Sarah moves to the stairwell entrance. The HOT OIL TRAP. Eli is already there, hand on the release.

                    SARAH
          Wait for it...

Liam appears on the stairs. Limping. Armor scorched. Helmet dented.

                    ELI
          NOW!

He releases the mechanism. The pot TIPS. Boiling oil POURS down.

Liam sees it—dives sideways. Most of the oil misses him, but some catches his shoulder, his arm.

He HOWLS. Rips off his jacket. The armor beneath saved him, but burns spread across exposed skin.

He retreats down the stairs. Pulls back into the burning first floor.

INT. REEVES HOUSE - FIRST FLOOR - CONTINUOUS

Liam staggers through smoke. Arm blistering. Leg burned. Multiple cuts bleeding.

He finds a window. Tries to climb out—

A CROSSBOW BOLT slams into the frame inches from his head.

Eli (o.s.), shouting from above.

                    ELI (O.S.)
          TWO MEN ENTER! ONE MAN LEAVES!

Liam spins. Eli stands at the top of the stairs, reloading.

Liam turns to himself.

                    LIAM
          Can't leave. Can't go up.

He looks at the burning walls around him. The smoke thickening.

                    LIAM
          Fine.

He moves toward the basement door.

INT. REEVES HOUSE - SECOND FLOOR - CONTINUOUS

Sarah pulls Eli back from the stairs.

                    SARAH
          He went down. Basement.

                    ELI
          I can go after him—

                    SARAH
          No. We hold the high ground. Let him come to us.

Eli's jaw tightens. He wants the kill. But he nods.

Sarah looks at Emma and Olivia, huddled together by the wall.

                    SARAH
          Stay close. Stay quiet.

Emma nods, arm around Olivia.

Below them, the first floor burns. Above them, the attic waits.

And somewhere in the basement, Liam is still coming.
