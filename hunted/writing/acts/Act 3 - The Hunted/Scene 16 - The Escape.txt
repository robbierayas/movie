## FULL SCRIPT

INT. REEVES HOUSE - ATTIC - NIGHT

Sarah waits in the darkness. Eyes fixed on the small attic window.

A SHADOW moves outside. LIAM's silhouette against the night sky.

GLASS SHATTERS.

Liam's arm reaches through, clearing jagged edges. He pulls himself up onto the windowsill.

Sarah charges.

She tackles him before he's fully inside. They crash into a stack of supplies—canned food scattering, shelving
collapsing.

Sarah claws at his face. His eyes. He blocks, catches her wrists.

Liam, grunting.

                    LIAM
          Still fighting. Good.

He headbutts her. She reels back.

Liam gets his legs through the window. Stands. He's a mess—burned, cut, bleeding—but still standing.

Sarah grabs a CANNED GOOD. Hurls it at his head. He ducks.

She backs toward the passage entrance. Needs to lead him away from the girls.

                    SARAH
          They're not here. Just me.

Liam, looking around.

                    LIAM
          Liar.

He spots the false wall panel. Slightly ajar.

                    LIAM
          There.

He moves toward it—

Sarah blocks his path. She has a UTILITY KNIFE now, pulled from the supplies.

                    SARAH
          Come on then. You wanted a challenge.

Liam smiles through blood.

                    LIAM
          Finally.

They fight. Close quarters in the cramped attic. Rafters overhead. Boxes and supplies crowding around them.

Sarah has the utility knife. Short blade. Sharp.

Liam has size. Strength. Desperation.

She strikes first. Slashes at his face.

He jerks back. The blade opens his cheek. Misses his eye by a centimeter.

He swings. Catches her ribs. She gasps—something CRACKS.

She stabs at his gut. He twists. Takes it in the hip instead. The blade sticks.

She pulls back. The knife stays in him.

Liam ROARS. Grabs her by the throat. Slams her against the wall.

Dust and insulation rain down. The attic shakes.

Sarah claws at his hand. Kicks at his legs.

He SQUEEZES. Her vision starts to blur.

She reaches back. Fingers find a CANNED GOOD on the shelf behind her.

Swings it. CRACK. Connects with his temple.

His grip loosens. She twists free.

He staggers. She scrambles toward the passage—

He catches her. Grabs her collar. Spins her around.

Punches her. Hard. She goes down.

He steps toward the passage entrance—

CLICK.

His foot catches a TRIP WIRE. Barely visible in the dim light.

A MECHANISM triggers. Hidden in the rafters.

A CROSSBOW. Mounted on a spring-loaded pivot. Aimed at knee height.

The bolt FIRES.

It slams into his thigh. Buries itself to the fletching. Hits femur.

Liam SCREAMS. His leg buckles. He drops to one knee.

                    LIAM
          ANOTHER FUCKING TRAP?!

The knife is still in his hip. The bolt is in his thigh. He can barely stand.

Sarah's already moving. On her feet despite the cracked ribs.

She TACKLES him. Drives her shoulder into the bolt.

TWISTS.

Liam HOWLS. Agony beyond words. The bolt grinds against bone.

He throws her off. Pure adrenaline. Pure rage.

She hits the floor. Rolls. Scrambles toward the passage entrance—

His hand shoots out. Catches her ankle. Iron grip.

Drags her back. Fingernails scraping the dusty floor.

Liam, through gritted teeth.

                    LIAM
          No more running.

He pulls her up by the throat. Pins her against the wall.

                    LIAM
          Where are they?

Sarah spits in his face.

                    SARAH
          Gone. You lose.

His grip tightens. Her face turns red.

                    LIAM
          Then you're all I have left.

He looks toward the passage entrance. Then back at her.

                    LIAM
          Let's see where that goes.

He drags her toward the passage. She struggles, but his grip is iron.

INT. SECRET PASSAGE - CONTINUOUS

The passage is narrow. Vertical ladder leading down through the walls.

Liam shoves Sarah ahead of him. They descend—Liam limping, bolt still in his thigh.

                    LIAM
          Your husband built this?

Sarah doesn't answer.

                    LIAM
          Clever. All this preparation... and it still wasn't enough.

They reach the bottom. The SECRET BASEMENT ROOM.

The exit—a hidden door to the outside—is OPEN. The girls got out.

Liam sees it. Rage flickers across his face.

Liam turns to Sarah.

                    LIAM
          Last chance. One more trap?

Sarah looks at him. Then at the floor beneath him.

She stomps on a loose FLOORBOARD.

A crude SPRING TRAP triggers. Nails. Buried points-up.

Liam's good leg takes the hit. Nails punch through his boot.

They BOTH go down—Sarah caught in the mechanism too, spikes tearing into her calf.

They lie in the darkness of the basement, tangled together, both wounded.

Liam laughs.

                    LIAM
          Got yourself too.

Sarah doesn't answer. Blood pools beneath them both.

EXT. REEVES PROPERTY - NIGHT

Emma and OLIVIA run through the darkness toward the road. The house burns behind them. Smoke rising against the stars.

They don't look back.

## Production Notes
[Placeholder for animation requirements, technical considerations]
- Emma's decision should feel earned—we've seen her growing fear
- Don't show the 911 call—the result speaks for itself
- Contrast: inside (violence) vs outside (escape to safety)
