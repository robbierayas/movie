## FULL SCRIPT

INT. REEVES HOUSE - ATTIC - NIGHT

Sarah waits in the darkness. Eyes fixed on the small attic window.

A SHADOW moves outside. LIAM's silhouette against the night sky.

GLASS SHATTERS.

Liam's arm reaches through, clearing jagged edges. He pulls himself up onto the windowsill.

Sarah charges.

She tackles him before he's fully inside. They crash into a stack of supplies—canned food scattering, shelving
collapsing.

Sarah claws at his face. His eyes. He blocks, catches her wrists.

Liam, grunting.

                    LIAM
          Still fighting. Good.

He headbutts her. She reels back.

Liam gets his legs through the window. Stands. He's a mess—burned, cut, bleeding—but still standing.

Sarah grabs a CANNED GOOD. Hurls it at his head. He ducks.

She backs toward the passage entrance. Needs to lead him away from the girls.

                    SARAH
          They're not here. Just me.

Liam, looking around.

                    LIAM
          Liar.

He spots the false wall panel. Slightly ajar.

                    LIAM
          There.

He moves toward it—

Sarah blocks his path. She has a UTILITY KNIFE now, pulled from the supplies.

                    SARAH
          Come on then. You wanted a challenge.

Liam smiles through blood.

                    LIAM
          Finally.

They fight. Close quarters. Brutal.

Liam is stronger, but hurt. Sarah is faster, but desperate.

She slashes his arm. He punches her ribs. She stabs at his face—he catches her wrist, twists. The knife clatters away.

Liam throws her against the wall. She hits hard. Slumps.

He steps toward the passage—

CLICK.

His foot catches a TRIP WIRE.

A MECHANISM triggers. A hidden crossbow mounted to the rafters.

The bolt slams into his thigh.

Liam SCREAMS. Drops to one knee.

                    LIAM
          ANOTHER FUCKING TRAP?!

Sarah's on her feet. She tackles him again—driving her shoulder into the bolt.

He howls. Throws her off.

She scrambles toward the passage entrance—

He grabs her ankle. Drags her back.

Liam, through gritted teeth.

                    LIAM
          No more running.

He pulls her up by the throat. Pins her against the wall.

                    LIAM
          Where are they?

Sarah spits in his face.

                    SARAH
          Gone. You lose.

His grip tightens. Her face turns red.

                    LIAM
          Then you're all I have left.

He looks toward the passage entrance. Then back at her.

                    LIAM
          Let's see where that goes.

He drags her toward the passage. She struggles, but his grip is iron.

INT. SECRET PASSAGE - CONTINUOUS

The passage is narrow. Vertical ladder leading down through the walls.

Liam shoves Sarah ahead of him. They descend—Liam limping, bolt still in his thigh.

                    LIAM
          Your husband built this?

Sarah doesn't answer.

                    LIAM
          Clever. All this preparation... and it still wasn't enough.

They reach the bottom. The SECRET BASEMENT ROOM.

The exit—a hidden door to the outside—is OPEN. The girls got out.

Liam sees it. Rage flickers across his face.

Liam turns to Sarah.

                    LIAM
          Last chance. One more trap?

Sarah looks at him. Then at the floor beneath him.

She stomps on a loose FLOORBOARD.

A crude SPRING TRAP triggers. Nails. Buried points-up.

Liam's good leg takes the hit. Nails punch through his boot.

They BOTH go down—Sarah caught in the mechanism too, spikes tearing into her calf.

They lie in the darkness of the basement, tangled together, both wounded.

Liam laughs.

                    LIAM
          Got yourself too.

Sarah doesn't answer. Blood pools beneath them both.

EXT. REEVES PROPERTY - NIGHT

Emma and OLIVIA run through the darkness toward the road. The house burns behind them. Smoke rising against the stars.

They don't look back.

## Production Notes
[Placeholder for animation requirements, technical considerations]
- Emma's decision should feel earned—we've seen her growing fear
- Don't show the 911 call—the result speaks for itself
- Contrast: inside (violence) vs outside (escape to safety)
