## SCENE LAYOUT

### Opening
Night. Liam returns to the Reeves property, expecting easy cleanup kills.

### Key Beats
1. Liam approaches the house confidently
2. First trap springs—he barely avoids it
3. Realization: they were waiting for him
4. The structure inverts: now Liam is the one being hunted
5. Running battle through the modified house begins
6. Each trap uses skills Hank taught his family

### Character Moments
- **Liam**: Overconfident, then shocked, then desperate.
- **Sarah**: Cold, tactical, waiting for her moment.
- **Eli**: Eager to engage, reckless.
- **Emma/Olivia**: Scared, staying back.

### Closing
Liam is now the prey. The family has the advantage—for now.
