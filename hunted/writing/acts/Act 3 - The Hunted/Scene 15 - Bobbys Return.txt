11. The stairs collapse from the fire damage. Liam needs to get out.
12. He heartlessly uses Bobby's body as a step stool to climb up.

## FULL SCRIPT

EXT. REEVES PROPERTY - NIGHT

BOBBY's SUV tears up the driveway, headlights cutting through smoke.

He barely stops before jumping out. Shotgun already in hand.

Bobby, calling out.

                    BOBBY
          Sarah! Eli!

No answer. Just crackling flames.

He scans the property. The house is burning—first floor engulfed, upper floors still holding. Smoke pours from broken
windows.

Then he sees her.

Girly. Lying motionless near the porch steps.

                    BOBBY
          No. No, no, no—

He runs to her. Drops to his knees. The shotgun clatters beside him.

                    BOBBY
          Girly? Come on, girl. Come on—

He checks her. She's breathing. Twitches.

Her eyes open. Dazed. Confused. But alive.

Bobby, relief flooding his voice.

                    BOBBY
          There you go. That's my girl. What happened? What did he do to you?

Girly struggles to her feet. Wobbly but recovering. She shakes her head, snorting.

Bobby looks at the burning house. Sets his jaw.

                    BOBBY
          Alright. Let's go hunting.

He picks up the shotgun. Girly falls in beside him—muscle memory from dozens of hunts.

INT. REEVES HOUSE - FIRST FLOOR - NIGHT

The fire has spread but not consumed everything. Smoke fills the air. Visibility is shit.

Bobby moves in, low. Girly beside him.

Bobby turns to Girly.

                    BOBBY
          Find 'em, girl. Find the family.

Girly sniffs. Snorts. The smoke is overwhelming her senses. She whines.

                    BOBBY
          I know. I know. Just do your best.

They move through the wreckage. Past overturned furniture. Broken glass. Blood spots.

Bobby checks corners with the shotgun. Girly checks with her nose.

They reach the basement door. It's open.

Bobby looks down into the darkness. Listens.

Movement below.

Bobby, whispering to Girly.

                    BOBBY
          Stay. Stay here, girl. Wait for me.

Girly whines but sits. Obedient. For now.

Bobby starts down the stairs. Shotgun first.

                    BOBBY
          I know you're down there, you piece of—

INT. REEVES HOUSE - BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS

Bobby is halfway down when his foot hits something slick.

He looks down. Liquid on the stairs. The smell hits him—

Accelerant.

Liam steps out of the shadows. Lighter in hand.

                    LIAM
          Should've stayed home, gun man.

He flicks the lighter.

WHOOSH.

The stairs ERUPT.

Bobby screams as fire races up his legs, his torso. He loses his footing. The shotgun flies from his grip as he tumbles
down the burning stairs.

He hits the concrete floor. Rolling. Burning.

Bobby, screaming.

                    BOBBY
          AAAHHHH—

Liam watches. Calm. Waiting.

Bobby's movements slow. The screaming becomes groaning. Then nothing.

Liam steps closer, looking down at the smoldering body.

                    LIAM
          Spray and pray. Neither one helped.

A GROWL from above.

Low. Primal. The sound of something that's decided to die fighting.

Liam looks up—

GIRLY launches herself down the burning stairs. Eighty pounds of muscle and teeth. Airborne. Coming straight at him.

                    LIAM
          What the—

She hits him like a freight train. All four paws driving into his chest. They go down HARD.

Liam's back slams against concrete. Air explodes from his lungs.

Girly's jaws find his forearm. The already-wounded one. Teeth SINK through flesh. Hit bone.

She shakes her head. Violent. Tearing.

Liam SCREAMS.

                    LIAM
          GET OFF—

He punches her head with his free hand. Once. Twice. Three times.

She doesn't let go. Her eyes are locked on his. Pure animal fury.

Blood pours from his arm. Muscle tearing. Tendons shredding.

He kicks. Tries to get leverage. She adjusts. Bites deeper.

They roll across the basement floor. Through debris. Through Bobby's blood.

Liam's free hand scrabbles across the concrete. Searching. Desperate.

Fingers close on something cold. Metal.

A PIPE. Rusted iron. Part of the old plumbing.

He swings one-handed. Weak angle.

CRACK. It connects with Girly's skull.

She yelps. Her grip loosens for a second.

Liam RIPS his arm free. Flesh tears. Blood sprays.

Girly recovers. Lunges again.

Liam swings the pipe. Full strength this time.

It catches her in the ribs. She goes sideways. Hits the floor.

She's up again immediately. Circling. Teeth bared. Blood on her muzzle—his blood.

She lunges.

Liam swings.

CRACK. Direct hit to the skull.

She stumbles. Legs wobbling. But still coming.

He swings again.

CRACK.

She goes down. Tries to rise. Front legs pushing. Back legs not working.

Still trying to reach him. Still trying to protect her family.

Liam stands over her. Pipe raised.

Girly looks up at him. Eyes dimming. But no fear. Just loyalty. Just love.

He brings the pipe down one final time.

She goes still.

Liam drops the pipe. It clangs against concrete.

He stands there gasping. Arm torn to ribbons. Burns on his legs. Blood everywhere—his, Bobby's, the dog's.

Above him, the burning stairs GROAN. CRACK.

The structure collapses. Flaming debris crashes down, blocking the way up.

Liam, looking around.

                    LIAM
          Shit.

He needs another way out. But first—

He looks at Bobby's body. Then at the collapsed stairs.

The pile of debris is too high to climb easily. But there's something that could help.

Without hesitation, Liam drags Bobby's body to the base of the wreckage. Props it against the debris.

He steps on Bobby's back. Uses the corpse as a step stool to reach the higher debris.

Climbs up. Pulls himself through the hole where the stairs used to be.

INT. REEVES HOUSE - FIRST FLOOR - CONTINUOUS

Liam emerges from the basement. Smoldering. Bleeding. Burned.

But alive.

He looks up toward the second floor.

Sarah's still up there. The kids too.

He's not done yet.

## Production Notes
- Bobby's death should hit hard—he was likeable in Scene 3 and 4
- Girly's death equally brutal—she was family
- Liam using Bobby's body as a step stool shows complete loss of humanity
- The "spray and pray" callback is cold
- This is the lowest point—even the reinforcements are dead
