## FULL SCRIPT

INT. SECRET BASEMENT ROOM - NIGHT

Darkness. Only the faint orange glow of fire seeping through cracks above. Smoke drifting down. The house GROANING overhead—wood cracking, structure failing.

Sarah and LIAM lie tangled in the wreckage of the spring trap. Blood pools beneath them. Nails embedded in flesh. Neither can stand.

For a long moment, neither moves. Just breathing. Wet. Ragged.

Then Liam stirs.

He drags himself toward her. Arm over arm. Inch by inch. Leaving a smear of blood across the concrete.

                    LIAM
          You... almost... won.

Sarah tries to crawl away. Her leg won't cooperate—the nails shredded muscle, severed tendons. It drags behind her like dead weight.

She claws at the floor. Fingernails breaking. Pulling herself forward.

Liam catches her ankle. The good one. Pulls himself closer.

She kicks. Weak. No strength left.

He keeps coming. Hand over hand up her body.

                    SARAH
          The girls... got out. Police... coming.

Liam pauses. Processes this. The hunt is over. He's lost.

But he's not done.

                    LIAM
          Then I better... finish... before they arrive.

He pulls himself on top of her. The weight of him pressing her into the concrete. His hands find her throat.

Sarah fights. Claws at his arms. Gouges at his eyes.

Her fingers rake across his cheek. Draw blood. But he doesn't stop.

She bucks. Twists. Tries to throw him off.

But she has nothing left. Days of fighting. Hours of running. Blood loss. Broken ribs.

His grip tightens.

                    LIAM
          I wanted a challenge. You gave me one.

Her face turns red. Then purple.

                    LIAM
          Thank you.

Sarah's struggles weaken. Her hands fall away from his wrists. Her eyes flutter—half-closed.

She's looking past him. At the ceiling. At something only she can see.

                    LIAM
          Say hi... to Hank.

He SQUEEZES.

Sarah's body arches once. Shudders.

Goes still.

Liam holds on. Thirty seconds. A minute. Making sure.

Then releases.

He collapses beside her. Chest heaving. Blood dripping from a dozen wounds. More broken than whole.

But alive.

Liam turns to himself.

                    LIAM
          Fuck.

He looks at the open exit door. Freedom. Just twenty feet away.

He starts crawling.

EXT. SECRET BASEMENT EXIT - NIGHT

Liam pulls himself through the hidden door. Out into the night air.

The house burns behind him. Flames licking up toward the roof.

He drags himself across the grass. Inch by inch.

Then he hears it.

SIRENS.

EXT. REEVES PROPERTY - CONTINUOUS

Police CARS tear up the driveway. Lights flashing. Red and blue cutting through the darkness.

Liam freezes.

He looks back at the burning house. At the open ground between him and escape.

No chance.

He reaches into his jacket. Pulls out HANK'S BLACKBELT. The trophy he kept.

He ties it around his head. A crude bandana.

Liam laughs.

                    LIAM
          One more challenge.

He reaches toward his waistband. Mimes the shape of guns with his hands.

Officers pour out of their vehicles. Weapons drawn.

                    OFFICER
          FREEZE! HANDS WHERE I CAN SEE THEM!

Liam raises his hands—still shaped like guns—and aims them at the officers.

                    LIAM
          BANG BANG.

The officers FIRE.

Liam's body jerks. Once. Twice. He crumples to the grass.

Silence. Then—

EXT. EDGE OF PROPERTY - CONTINUOUS

Emma and OLIVIA watch from behind a police car. A FEMALE OFFICER has an arm around each of them.

They watch Liam fall.

They don't cry. They don't cheer.

They just watch.

Female officer, gently.

                    FEMALE OFFICER
          It's over. You're safe now.

Emma looks at the burning house. At the body on the lawn.

Then at her little sister.

Emma, quietly.

                    EMMA
          Let's go.

They turn away.

Behind them, the house continues to burn. FIREFIGHTERS arriving now. PARAMEDICS running toward the fallen bodies.

But for Emma and Olivia Reeves, the nightmare is over.

They chose the sensible option.

They survived.

FADE OUT.
