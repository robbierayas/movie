### Character Moments

- **Liam**: Wins the fight but loses the war. Caught not by ingenuity but by a phone call.

## FULL SCRIPT

INT. SECRET BASEMENT ROOM - NIGHT

Darkness. Smoke seeping in from above. The house groaning.

Sarah and LIAM lie in the wreckage of the spring trap. Blood everywhere. Neither can stand.

Liam moves first. Drags himself toward Sarah.

Liam, ragged breathing.

                    LIAM
          You... almost... won.

Sarah tries to crawl away. Her leg won't cooperate. Torn muscle. Severed tendons.

Liam grabs her ankle. Pulls himself closer.

Sarah, weak.

                    SARAH
          The girls... got out. Police... coming.

                    LIAM
          Then I better... finish... before they arrive.

He pulls himself on top of her. Hands finding her throat.

Sarah fights. Claws at him. But she has nothing left.

Liam, squeezing.

                    LIAM
          I wanted a challenge. You gave me one. Thank you.

Sarah's struggles weaken. Her eyes flutter.

                    LIAM
          Say hi... to Hank.

Her body goes still.

Liam holds on for another moment. Making sure. Then releases.

He collapses beside her. Gasping.

Liam turns to himself.

                    LIAM
          Fuck.

He looks at the open exit door. Freedom. Just twenty feet away.

He starts crawling.

EXT. SECRET BASEMENT EXIT - NIGHT

Liam pulls himself through the hidden door. Out into the night air.

The house burns behind him. Flames licking up toward the roof.

He drags himself across the grass. Inch by inch.

Then he hears it.

SIRENS.

EXT. REEVES PROPERTY - CONTINUOUS

Police CARS tear up the driveway. Lights flashing. Red and blue cutting through the darkness.

Liam freezes.

He looks back at the burning house. At the open ground between him and escape.

No chance.

He reaches into his jacket. Pulls out HANK'S BLACKBELT. The trophy he kept.

He ties it around his head. A crude bandana.

Liam laughs.

                    LIAM
          One more challenge.

He reaches toward his waistband. Mimes the shape of guns with his hands.

Officers pour out of their vehicles. Weapons drawn.

                    OFFICER
          FREEZE! HANDS WHERE I CAN SEE THEM!

Liam raises his hands—still shaped like guns—and aims them at the officers.

                    LIAM
          BANG BANG.

The officers FIRE.

Liam's body jerks. Once. Twice. He crumples to the grass.

Silence. Then—

EXT. EDGE OF PROPERTY - CONTINUOUS

Emma and OLIVIA watch from behind a police car. A FEMALE OFFICER has an arm around each of them.

They watch Liam fall.

They don't cry. They don't cheer.

They just watch.

Female officer, gently.

                    FEMALE OFFICER
          It's over. You're safe now.

Emma looks at the burning house. At the body on the lawn.

Then at her little sister.

Emma, quietly.

                    EMMA
          Let's go.

They turn away.

Behind them, the house continues to burn. FIREFIGHTERS arriving now. PARAMEDICS running toward the fallen bodies.

But for Emma and Olivia Reeves, the nightmare is over.

They chose the sensible option.

They survived.

FADE OUT.
