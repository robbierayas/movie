## SCENE LAYOUT

### Opening
Liam catches Sarah. The battle has left both of them severely wounded.

### Key Beats
1. Liam begins torturing Sarah
2. While torturing her, he accidentally activates one of her traps
3. Now both are wounded, disabled—can barely move
4. Brutal, crawling struggle with each other, both broken
5. Liam kills Sarah
6. Exhausted, he staggers toward escape
7. Police cars surround the property—lights, sirens
8. Emma and Olivia watch from a safe distance
9. Liam is arrested

### Character Moments
- **Sarah**: Dies to her own trap, killed by Liam. The tragedy of revenge.
- **Liam**: Wins the fight but loses the war. Caught not by ingenuity but by a phone call.
- **Emma/Olivia**: Safe because they chose the sensible option.

### Closing
The killer is caught. The children survive. The irony: survivalist ingenuity failed; a 911 call succeeded.
