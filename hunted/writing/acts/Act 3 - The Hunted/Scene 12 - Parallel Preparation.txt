## FULL SCRIPT

INT. ABANDONED BUILDING - DAY

LIAM sits in a dusty corner. Makeshift camp—sleeping bag, first aid supplies, bottled water.

He unwraps bloody bandages from his torso. Examines the wounds. Grimaces.

On the floor beside him: HANK'S BLACKBELT. He picks it up. Studies it.

LIAM
(quietly)
You earned this.

He sets it aside carefully. A trophy.

INT. REEVES HOUSE - DAY

SARAH and ELI work on a trap. Sarah guides a CABLE through an eyelet. Eli tests the tension.

Behind them, EMMA and OLIVIA sort supplies. Their movements are mechanical. Reluctant.

Emma glances at the window. The outside world.

INT. ABANDONED BUILDING - DAY

Liam unpacks a DRONE from a box. Small, commercial model. He attaches something to its underside—a modified BB gun mechanism.

He tests the controls. The drone lifts, hovers, responds.

He smiles.

INT. REEVES HOUSE - NIGHT

Emma and Olivia sit on the floor, wiring a simple alarm. Olivia's hands shake.

OLIVIA
(whispered)
I want to go to Aunt Rachel's.

EMMA
(whispered back)
Me too.

They hear footsteps. Sarah appears in the doorway.

SARAH
How's it coming?

The girls put on brave faces.

EMMA
Almost done.

Sarah nods. Moves on. The girls exchange another look.

INT. ABANDONED BUILDING - DAY

Liam does push-ups. Sit-ups. Tests his range of motion. Winces but pushes through.

He examines himself in a cracked mirror. The bruises are fading. The swelling down.

He picks up a WELDING HELMET. Tries it on. Adds a layer of MAKESHIFT ARMOR—metal plates strapped to his torso with belts.

He looks like a nightmare.

INT. REEVES HOUSE - NIGHT

The house is transformed. TRIP WIRES. POSITIONED WEAPONS. Sealed windows. Blockaded secondary entrances.

Sarah stands at the center, surveying.

ELI
We're ready.

Sarah shakes her head.

SARAH
Not yet. More.

Emma watches from the stairs. Her expression: this will never end.

EXT. RURAL ROAD - NIGHT

Liam's car moves through darkness. No headlights.

INT. REEVES HOUSE - NIGHT

Sarah sits by the window. Watching. Waiting.

The family sleeps behind her—or tries to.

She doesn't blink.

EXT. REEVES PROPERTY - NIGHT

The car pulls off the road. Disappears into the trees.

A figure emerges. Drone in hand. Armor glinting in moonlight.

LIAM walks toward the house.

INT. REEVES HOUSE - NIGHT

Sarah's eyes narrow. Movement in the treeline.

SARAH
(calling softly)
He's here.
