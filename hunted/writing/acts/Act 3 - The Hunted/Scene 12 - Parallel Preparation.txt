## FULL SCRIPT

INT. ABANDONED BUILDING - DAY

Liam sits in a dusty corner. Makeshift camp—sleeping bag, first aid supplies, bottled water.

He unwraps bloody bandages from his torso. Examines the wounds. Grimaces.

On the floor beside him: HANK'S BLACKBELT. He picks it up. Studies it.

Liam, quietly.

                    LIAM
          You earned this.

He sets it aside carefully. A trophy.

INT. REEVES HOUSE - DAY

Sarah and ELI work on a trap. Sarah guides a CABLE through an eyelet. Eli tests the tension.

Behind them, EMMA and OLIVIA sort supplies. Their movements are mechanical. Reluctant.

Emma glances at the window. The outside world.

INT. ABANDONED BUILDING - DAY

Liam unpacks a DRONE from a box. Small, commercial model. He attaches something to its underside—a modified BB gun
mechanism.

He tests the controls. The drone lifts, hovers, responds.

He smiles.

INT. REEVES HOUSE - NIGHT

Emma and Olivia sit on the floor, wiring a simple alarm. Olivia's hands shake.

Olivia, quietly.

                    OLIVIA
          I want to go to Aunt Rachel's.

Emma, whispered back.

                    EMMA
          Me too.

They hear footsteps. Sarah appears in the doorway.

                    SARAH
          How's it coming?

The girls put on brave faces.

                    EMMA
          Almost done.

Sarah nods. Moves on. The girls exchange another look.

INT. ABANDONED BUILDING - DAY

Liam does push-ups. Sit-ups. Tests his range of motion. Winces but pushes through.

He examines himself in a cracked mirror. The bruises are fading. The swelling down.

He picks up a DIRTBIKE HELMET. Examines it. Holds up small metal plates and a drill.

CUT TO: The helmet now has metal plates drilled around the outside—top, sides, back. DIY armor. Ugly but functional.

He tries it on. Flips the sun visor up and down. Can see clearly. Good.

He adds the MAKESHIFT ARMOR—a vest covered in small metal plates (~3x2 inches each) sewn together in overlapping rows like fish scales. Arm and leg pieces follow. Chainmail-style gloves with leather fingers.

He looks like a nightmare. A homemade knight.

He picks up Hank's blackbelt. Ties it around his arm like a trophy.

                    LIAM
          Let's finish this.

INT. REEVES HOUSE - NIGHT

The house is transformed. TRIP WIRES. POSITIONED WEAPONS. Sealed windows. Blockaded secondary entrances.

Sarah stands at the center, surveying.

                    ELI
          We're ready.

Sarah shakes her head.

                    SARAH
          Not yet. More.

Emma watches from the stairs. Her expression: this will never end.

EXT. RURAL ROAD - NIGHT

Liam's car moves through darkness. No headlights.

INT. REEVES HOUSE - NIGHT

Sarah sits by the window. Watching. Waiting.

The family sleeps behind her—or tries to.

She doesn't blink.

EXT. REEVES PROPERTY - NIGHT

The car pulls off the road. Disappears into the trees.

A figure emerges. Drone in hand. Armor glinting in moonlight.

Liam walks toward the house.

INT. REEVES HOUSE - NIGHT

Sarah's eyes narrow. Movement in the treeline.

Sarah, calling softly.

                    SARAH
          He's here.
