## FULL SCRIPT

INT. REEVES HOUSE - BASEMENT - NIGHT

Sarah descends the stairs, flashlight in hand. She scans Hank's prepper storage: shelves of supplies, tools, emergency gear.

She starts pulling items: trip wire, steel cables, a propane tank, containers of oil.

ELI appears behind her.

ELI
What do you need?

SARAH
Everything.

INT. REEVES HOUSE - SECOND FLOOR - NIGHT

Eli sets up a HOTPLATE near the stairwell. Places a large pot on top. Fills it with cooking oil.

He positions a QUIVER OF ARROWS against the wall. Checks sight lines to the stairs below.

ELI
(to himself)
Perfect.

INT. REEVES HOUSE - FIRST FLOOR - NIGHT

EMMA and OLIVIA move through the first floor. Emma closes and locks windows. Olivia follows, doing the same with doors.

OLIVIA
Why are we doing this?

EMMA
Mom said to.

OLIVIA
But... shouldn't we just leave?

Emma pauses. Looks at her little sister.

EMMA
I don't think Mom wants to leave.

They exchange a look. Fear.

INT. REEVES HOUSE - VARIOUS - NIGHT

MONTAGE of trap-building:

- Sarah rigs a MOLOTOV COCKTAIL above the main doorway, connected to trip wire.

- Eli tests a CROSSBOW, aiming down the stairwell.

- Sarah positions BROKEN GLASS beneath windows.

- Emma and Olivia watch from a doorway, holding each other.

INT. REEVES HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

The family gathers. The house looks different now—weapons positioned, trip wires barely visible, defensive positions established.

EMMA
Mom... this feels wrong.

SARAH
It'll feel right when he's dead.

OLIVIA
(small voice)
What if he doesn't come back?

Sarah's expression hardens.

SARAH
He'll come back. He can't help himself.

Eli puts a hand on Emma's shoulder.

ELI
Hey. Dad taught us to protect ourselves. That's what we're doing.

EMMA
Dad never wanted us to—

ELI
Dad's dead.

Silence. Emma looks away. Olivia buries her face in Emma's side.

Sarah stares at the front door. Waiting.

SARAH
He'll come. And we'll be ready.
