## FULL SCRIPT

EXT. REEVES DRIVEWAY - DUSK

Hank's truck turns off the main road onto the long driveway. Gravel crunches under tires.

Halfway up the drive—THUMP THUMP THUMP.

The truck pulls to the side. Hank climbs out, walks around to the front passenger tire. Flat.

He crouches. Examines it.

A CLEAN SLASH across the sidewall. Not a puncture. A cut.

Hank's head snaps up. His eyes scan the treeline.

Hank, quietly.

                    HANK
          Shit.

He reaches back into the truck—pulls a HANDGUN from under the seat. Chambers a round.

Movement in the trees. Hank spots it.

An ARROW whistles through the air—

Hank dives. Hits gravel hard. The arrow THUNKS into the truck door where his head was.

He's up and running before the echo fades. Sprinting toward the house. Two hundred feet of open ground.

His boots pound the dirt. Heart hammering. Eyes locked on the porch.

Another arrow hisses past. Misses wide—Liam's shooting uphill, compensating wrong.

Liam emerges from the treeline, COMPOUND BOW in hand. He nocks another arrow, walking calmly. No rush. The predator's confident pace.

                    LIAM
          Thought you preferred knives!

Hank doesn't waste breath answering. Fifty feet to the porch.

He reaches into his pocket—pulls out a FLASHBANG. Pops the pin.

Throws it behind him without looking. Muscle memory. Combat instinct.

BANG. Blinding white light.

Liam staggers, eyes watering. Drops the bow. Claws at his face.

                    LIAM
          Fuck—

EXT. REEVES PORCH - CONTINUOUS

Hank reaches the porch stairs. Takes them two at a time—

His hand grabs the HANDRAIL.

His momentum stops dead.

NAILS. Driven through from underneath. Points up. Five of them buried in his palm.

Hank SCREAMS. Tries to pull free—the nails TEAR through flesh. Blood sprays across the wood.

His legs buckle. He goes down hard on the porch steps.

The gun clatters from his grip. Spins across the weathered boards.

Hank scrambles after it on hands and knees. Blood smears behind him. His ruined hand leaves wet red prints.

Behind him, Liam recovers. Blinks away tears. Sees his target crawling.

He CHARGES up the stairs.

Hank's fingers brush the gun—

Liam's boot SLAMS down on his wrist. Bones grind. Hank roars.

The boot sweeps sideways. The gun skitters off the porch, disappears into the bushes below.

Liam drops onto Hank's back. Knee between the shoulder blades. HUNTING KNIFE drawn.

Hank bucks. Rolls. They tumble together.

Now Liam's on top, knife plunging down—

Hank catches the blade-arm with his good hand. Both hands locked on Liam's wrist. The knife trembles three inches from his throat.

Liam's weight behind it. Pushing. The tip touches skin.

                    LIAM
          Took you long enough to figure it out.

Hank's wounded hand slips. Blood making everything slick.

The knife dips closer. Two inches now.

Hank doesn't answer. Saves his breath.

He HEADBUTTS upward. Full force. The crown of his skull into Liam's face.

CRACK. Cartilage crunches. Liam's nose shatters.

Blood sprays. Liam recoils, grip loosening.

Hank draws his knees to his chest. Plants both feet on Liam's sternum.

SHOVES.

Every ounce of desperate strength.

Liam flies backward. Crashes through the porch railing. Splinters explode. He falls four feet and hits the ground hard.

Hank's already moving. On his feet despite the agony. One hand gushing blood, dripping down his forearm. He fumbles for his keys with his good hand.

Liam (o.s.) laughs.

                    LIAM (O.S.)
          Oh, you're good...

Hank jams the key in the lock. Turns it.

He's inside. SLAMS the door. DEADBOLT. CHAIN.

INT. REEVES HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Hank backs away from the door, breathing hard. Blood dripping from his ruined hand.

He looks at the wound. Deep. Multiple punctures. He'll lose function if he doesn't treat it.

A CRASH.

He spins. A ROCK smashes through the living room window.

Another CRASH. Another window.

EXT. REEVES PORCH - CONTINUOUS

Liam grabs anything he can find—rocks, a garden gnome, a potted plant—hurling them through windows.

                    LIAM
          Come on out, Hank! We're just getting started!

Glass shatters. Again. Again.

INT. REEVES HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Hank doesn't panic. He's already moving deeper into the house.

He knows this isn't over. It's just beginning.
