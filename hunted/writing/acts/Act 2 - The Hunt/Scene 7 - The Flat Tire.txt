## FULL SCRIPT

EXT. REEVES DRIVEWAY - DUSK

Hank's truck turns off the main road onto the long driveway. Gravel crunches under tires.

Halfway up the drive—THUMP THUMP THUMP.

The truck pulls to the side. Hank climbs out, walks around to the front passenger tire. Flat.

He crouches. Examines it.

A CLEAN SLASH across the sidewall. Not a puncture. A cut.

Hank's head snaps up. His eyes scan the treeline.

HANK
(quietly)
Shit.

He reaches back into the truck—pulls a HANDGUN from under the seat. Chambers a round.

Movement in the trees. Hank spots it.

An ARROW whistles through the air—

Hank dives. The arrow THUNKS into the truck door where his head was.

He's up and running. Sprinting toward the house. Two hundred feet of open ground.

Another arrow flies. Misses wide.

LIAM emerges from the treeline, COMPOUND BOW in hand. He nocks another arrow, walking calmly. No rush.

LIAM
Thought you preferred knives!

Hank doesn't answer. He's focused. Fifty feet to the porch.

He reaches into his pocket—pulls out a FLASHBANG. Pops the pin.

Throws it behind him without looking.

BANG. Blinding white light.

Liam staggers, eyes watering. Drops the bow.

LIAM
Fuck—

EXT. REEVES PORCH - CONTINUOUS

Hank reaches the porch stairs. Takes them two at a time—

His hand grabs the HANDRAIL.

NAILS. Driven through from underneath. Points up.

Hank SCREAMS. His palm impaled. He yanks his hand free—blood spraying—loses his balance.

The gun clatters across the porch.

Hank scrambles for it on hands and knees, leaving bloody handprints.

Behind him, Liam recovers. Charges up the stairs.

Hank reaches the gun—

Liam's boot KICKS it away. It skitters off the porch into the bushes.

Hank rolls onto his back. Liam drops on top of him, HUNTING KNIFE drawn.

They struggle. Hank catches Liam's wrist with his good hand. The knife trembles inches from his throat.

LIAM
(straining)
Took you long enough to figure it out.

Hank doesn't waste breath talking. He headbutts Liam—CRACK—nose breaking.

Liam recoils. Hank gets his legs up, plants both feet on Liam's chest.

SHOVES.

Liam flies backward. Crashes through the porch railing. Falls four feet to the ground.

Hank's on his feet. One hand gushing blood. He fumbles for his keys with his good hand.

LIAM (O.S.)
(groaning, laughing)
Oh, you're good...

Hank jams the key in the lock. Turns it.

He's inside. SLAMS the door. DEADBOLT. CHAIN.

INT. REEVES HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Hank backs away from the door, breathing hard. Blood dripping from his ruined hand.

He looks at the wound. Deep. Multiple punctures. He'll lose function if he doesn't treat it.

A CRASH.

He spins. A ROCK smashes through the living room window.

Another CRASH. Another window.

EXT. REEVES PORCH - CONTINUOUS

Liam grabs anything he can find—rocks, a garden gnome, a potted plant—hurling them through windows.

LIAM
Come on out, Hank! We're just getting started!

Glass shatters. Again. Again.

INT. REEVES HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Hank doesn't panic. He's already moving deeper into the house.

He knows this isn't over. It's just beginning.
