# Scene 10 - Sarah's Investigation

## LOCATION
VARIOUS - DAY/NIGHT

## CHARACTERS
Sarah, Eli, Liam (observed, not POV)

## SCENE LAYOUT

### Opening
Sarah doesn't go to the police. She investigates on her own, with Eli's help.

### Key Beats
1. Police questioning Sarah ask if she knows the guy and why she fired her gun. They can't tell which gun shot Hank yet.
It'd be easier with the camera footage. Sarah says Hank was in charge of that, annoying police. They keep their guns
4. Sarah pieces together clues from the crime scene and tracks leads. She shows camera footage picture of Liam to Bobby
and Cabela's worker, gets close to identifying him
2. We shift to an unbiased view of Liam—not his voiceover, but who he really is. She somehow gets his work address and
questions people there. Liam's reality: invisible bartender, cramped apartment, pathetic life
5. She finds him—Eli is with her. Walking up to the apartment door, he is about to leave and bumps into them.
6. Sarah attacks Liam through the apartment building
7. Liam barely escapes
8. As he flees, Liam writes on car window: "cya soon"
9. Sarah has confirmed her target but lost him

### Character Moments
- **Sarah**: Cold determination. The skills Hank taught her now serve a darker purpose.
- **Eli**: Shares Sarah's mission, helps with the investigation.
- **Liam**: Revealed as pathetic when seen objectively. But still dangerous.

### Closing
Sarah knows who he is. She knows he'll come back. She'll be ready.

## FULL SCRIPT

INT. REEVES HOUSE - DAY

Two DETECTIVES sit across from Sarah at her kitchen table. The house is still a crime scene—tape, markers, evidence bags.

Detective 1
The security footage. We need access.

                    SARAH
          Hank handled all that. I don't know the passwords.

Detective 1
(frustrated)
Mrs. Reeves—

                    SARAH
          I gave you a description. I fired my gun at him. That's all I know.

The detectives exchange looks. They're not getting anywhere.

INT. SARAH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Sarah sits at a laptop. ELI beside her. Security footage plays—a grainy image of LIAM's face captured through a window.

She screenshots it. Prints it.

                    ELI
          What are you going to do?

                    SARAH
          What they won't.

EXT. CABELA'S PARKING LOT - DAY

Sarah shows the photo to a STORE EMPLOYEE smoking by the loading dock.

                    EMPLOYEE
          Yeah, I remember him. Was looking at knives. Talked to some guy for a bit.

                    SARAH
          What guy?

INT. BOBBY'S HOUSE - DAY

Bobby stares at the photo. Recognition.

                    BOBBY
          That's... that's the guy from the store. He was asking Hank questions about—

His face goes pale.

                    BOBBY
          Oh God. He was at the store with us?

Sarah's jaw tightens.

                    SARAH
          Where does he work? You said he was "learning." Learning what?

INT. DIVE BAR - NIGHT

Sarah stands at the bar. Different bartender working. She shows the photo.

                    BARTENDER
          Liam? Yeah, he worked here. Quit a few weeks back. No notice, just gone.

                    SARAH
          Address?

The bartender hesitates.

Sarah, cold.

                    SARAH
          He killed my husband.

The bartender writes something on a napkin.

EXT. LIAM'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

A run-down building. Cracked sidewalks. Rusted fire escapes.

Sarah and Eli approach the entrance. Eli's hand rests on something in his jacket—a weapon.

                    SARAH
          Stay behind me.

They enter the building. Climb stairs. The hallway smells like mildew and old cooking.

Stop at apartment 3B.

Sarah reaches for the door—

It OPENS.

Liam stands there, bag over his shoulder. Keys in hand. Leaving.

For a split second, everyone freezes.

Recognition flickers across Liam's face. The wife. Here.

Then Sarah LUNGES.

No hesitation. No words. Pure violence.

She tackles Liam back into the apartment. They crash through the doorframe. Slam into his RESEARCH TABLE—the murder wall of photos and notes exploding around them. Pictures of her family scattering across the floor.

Sarah's on top. Straddling him. Fists HAMMERING down.

                    SARAH
          YOU TOOK EVERYTHING FROM ME!

Left. Right. Left. Each word punctuated by a blow.

Liam covers his face. Eats punches. Tries to protect himself.

She's not trained like Hank. But she's ANGRY. And fast.

Her fist catches his jaw. His lip splits.

Her palm strikes his nose—the one Hank broke. Still healing. It CRUNCHES again.

Liam HOWLS. Bucks his hips. Throws her off.

Sarah hits the floor. Rolls. Already getting up—

Eli rushes in. BATON raised. Aiming for Liam's skull.

Liam sees it coming. Twists sideways. The baton CRACKS against his shoulder instead.

He grabs the BOOKSHELF beside him. Cheap particle board. Shoves it.

The shelf TOPPLES onto Eli. Books and clothes and junk burying the boy. He goes down hard.

                    ELI
          Mom—!

Sarah doesn't check on him. Eyes locked on Liam.

She grabs a LAMP from the cluttered desk. Ceramic base. Heavy.

Swings.

CRACK. It connects with Liam's shoulder. His arm goes numb.

He backpedals. She presses. Swings again.

This time he's ready. Ducks under it.

His foot SWEEPS her legs. Hard and fast.

Sarah's feet fly out from under her. She hits the floor HARD. Back of her head bouncing off cheap linoleum.

Stars explode behind her eyes.

Liam doesn't press his advantage. He's already moving. Scrambling for the window. The fire escape.

                    SARAH
          NO!

She lunges from the floor. Grabs his ankle. Fingernails digging into flesh.

He kicks. Once. Twice.

His heel catches her forearm. Her grip breaks.

He's through the window. Out onto the rusted metal platform.

EXT. FIRE ESCAPE - CONTINUOUS

Liam half-falls down the rusty ladder. Rungs groaning under his weight. Moving fast. Sloppy.

Sarah's right behind him. Climbing through the window.

He reaches the second floor platform. Looks down. Ten feet to the alley.

Jumps.

Lands hard. Rolls. Up and running.

Sarah doesn't hesitate. She jumps after him—

Her landing is bad. Ankle TWISTS on loose gravel. Something pops.

She stumbles. Goes to one knee.

EXT. ALLEY - CONTINUOUS

Liam reaches his car. Yanks open the door.

Sarah limps toward him, fury in her eyes.

Liam pauses. Pulls out a marker. Writes on his car window:

                    CYA SOON

He gives her a little wave. Gets in. Drives.

Sarah stands in the alley, breathing hard. Eli catches up, holding his ribs.

                    ELI
          Mom...

Sarah, staring after the car.

                    SARAH
          Now I know who he is. And he's coming back.

She turns to Eli.

                    SARAH
          We need to get ready.

## Production Notes
[Placeholder for animation requirements, technical considerations]
- Show unbiased view of Liam—contrast with his self-aggrandizing voiceover from Act 1
- The attack should be sudden and violent—Sarah isn't hesitating
- "I'll visit soon" establishes Liam's arrogance and sets up Act 3
