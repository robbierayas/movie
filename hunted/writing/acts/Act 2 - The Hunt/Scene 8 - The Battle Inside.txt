## FULL SCRIPT

INT. REEVES HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Hank moves through the dim house. Blood trails behind him from his mangled hand.

He stops at a hallway closet. Opens it. Inside: a BLACK BELT hanging on a hook. A pair of SAI mounted on the wall.

He wraps the belt tight around his wounded hand. Pulls it with his teeth. Makeshift tourniquet.

He takes one sai. Tests its weight. Familiar.

A CREAK from the living room.

Hank freezes. Listens.

INT. REEVES HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Liam climbs through a shattered window. Glass crunches under his boots. His nose is swollen, blood dried on his upper
lip.

He scans the room. Hunting trophies on the walls. Competition ribbons. Family photos.

Liam, muttering.

                    LIAM
          Some fortress.

He draws his hunting knife. Moves deeper into the house.

INT. REEVES HOUSE - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Hank waits around a corner. Back pressed to the wall. Breathing controlled despite the pain.

He can hear Liam's footsteps. Boot on hardwood. Careful now. Hunting.

Closer.

Closer.

Liam rounds the corner—

Hank STRIKES.

The sai flashes out. Catches Liam's knife arm between the twin prongs. TWISTS.

Liam's wrist bends wrong. Tendons strain. His fingers spasm open.

The hunting knife clatters to the floor.

Liam throws a wild haymaker. Desperate. Off-balance.

Hank ducks under it. Drives the blunt end of the sai into Liam's ribs. Short. Brutal.

Liam doubles over, gasping.

                    LIAM
          The fuck—

Hank doesn't let him finish. He's already moving. Controlled. Efficient. Years of training flowing through muscle memory.

A strike to the thigh—dead leg. Liam stumbles.

A strike to the shoulder—arm goes numb. Liam can't block.

Liam backpedals. Crashes into a SIDE TABLE. A lamp wobbles, falls, SHATTERS on the floor.

Hank hesitates. Looks at the broken lamp.

His house. His things. Sarah's grandmother's lamp.

That hesitation costs him.

Liam grabs a DINING CHAIR. Swings it like a bat. Full strength. Desperate.

CRACK. It connects with Hank's shoulder. Wood splinters. Hank staggers sideways.

Liam swings again. Hank blocks with the sai—absorbs the impact—but his wounded hand SCREAMS with pain.

Liam sees the weakness. Targets it.

He grabs a BOOKSHELF. Throws his weight against it.

The shelf TOPPLES. Books avalanche. Hunting trophies crash. Photo frames shatter. All of it piling onto Hank.

Hank disappears under the debris.

Liam backs away. Breathing hard. Blood streaming from his broken nose. Arm hanging wrong where the sai struck.

                    LIAM
          This wasn't supposed to be this hard.

The debris SHIFTS.

Hank rises like a specter from the wreckage. Bleeding from a gash on his forehead now. Glass in his hair. But still standing. Still holding the sai.

He doesn't respond. Doesn't waste breath.

He closes distance.

They clash in the LIVING ROOM. Trading blows.

Hank is faster. More skilled. Every strike precise. Controlled power.

But Liam fights DIRTY.

An elbow to the throat when Hank commits to a strike. Hank gags, steps back.

A knee to the groin when Hank reaches for him. Hank doubles.

Liam grabs the FIREPLACE POKER. Heavy iron. Swings wild.

Hank brings up the sai to block—CLANG—the impact jars his wounded hand. The makeshift bandage slips. Blood flows fresh.

Hank SCREAMS through gritted teeth. Nearly drops the weapon.

Liam presses. Swings again. And again.

Hank blocks. Ducks. Sidesteps. Losing ground. Being driven back.

Liam grabs a CERAMIC VASE from the mantle. Hurls it.

It SHATTERS against Hank's skull. He drops to one knee. Vision swimming.

Liam stands over him. Gasping for air. Both of them wrecked.

                    LIAM
          Just... fucking... DIE.

Hank looks up. Blood in his eyes.

He surges upward—HEADBUTTS Liam in the face. AGAIN. Same spot.

Liam's already-broken nose CRUNCHES. Something gives way inside. The cartilage flattens completely.

Liam HOWLS. Staggers backward. Hands flying to his ruined face. Blind with pain.

Hank raises the sai for a killing blow. Arm drawn back. Point aimed at Liam's chest.

This is it—

Liam's hand shoots out. Grabs a TOPPLED POTTED PLANT. Flings DIRT into Hank's eyes.

Hank swings blind. The sai whistles past Liam's ear. Misses by an inch.

Liam tackles him. Low. Under the swing.

They CRASH through the COFFEE TABLE. Glass and wood exploding around them.

They hit the ground tangled together. Rolling. Punching. Gouging. No technique now. Just survival.

Liam bites. Hank headbutts. Liam claws. Hank elbows.

They slam into the wall. Into the couch. Knock over an end table. A lamp EXPLODES.

Hank gets on top. Bloodied hands find Liam's throat. Start to squeeze.

But his wounded hand—the one with nail holes through the palm—it can't grip. The belt-tourniquet has come loose. Blood makes everything slick.

Liam thrashes. Kicks. His fingers scrabble across the debris-strewn floor.

They close on something.

A BROKEN TABLE LEG. Jagged end. Eighteen inches of splintered wood.

Liam swings it up. No aim. Just force.

The jagged end DRIVES into Hank's side. Below the ribs. Deep.

Hank gasps. Eyes go wide.

He looks down. Sees the wood jutting from his torso. Dark blood welling around it.

His grip on Liam's throat loosens.

He slumps sideways. Off of Liam. Onto his back.

The sai falls from his grip. Clatters away across the floor.

He stares at the ceiling. Breathing wet. Shallow.

INT. REEVES HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Both men lie in the wreckage, gasping.

Liam sits up first. Wipes blood from his face. Crawls to where Hank's gun landed in the bushes earlier—no. It's gone.

He spots it across the room. Must have come in through the window with him.

He drags himself to it. Picks it up.

Hank lies on the floor. Breathing wet, ragged. The table leg still in his side. He's not getting up.

Liam staggers over. Stands above him.

                    LIAM
          Good game.

Hank looks up at him. No fear. Just exhaustion.

Hank, barely audible.

                    HANK
          My family. They're not part of this.

Liam shakes their head.

                    LIAM
          I've got no interest in your family, Hank. They're not the challenge.

He aims the gun.

                    LIAM
          You were.

BANG.

Hank's body goes still.

Liam stands there, swaying. Blood dripping from a dozen wounds. He looks around at the destroyed room.

Liam turns to himself.

                    LIAM
          Fuck.

He starts to move toward the door—

HEADLIGHTS sweep across the walls through the broken windows.

A car pulling up the driveway.

Liam freezes.

## Production Notes
[Placeholder for animation requirements, technical considerations]
- Violence should be visceral—injuries matter, exhaustion matters
- Show Hank's near-victories to establish him as a formidable opponent
- Hunting awards visible as ironic foreshadowing
