## FULL SCRIPT

INT. REEVES HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Hank moves through the dim house. Blood trails behind him from his mangled hand.

He stops at a hallway closet. Opens it. Inside: a BLACK BELT hanging on a hook. A pair of SAI mounted on the wall.

He wraps the belt tight around his wounded hand. Pulls it with his teeth. Makeshift tourniquet.

He takes one sai. Tests its weight. Familiar.

A CREAK from the living room.

Hank freezes. Listens.

INT. REEVES HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Liam climbs through a shattered window. Glass crunches under his boots. His nose is swollen, blood dried on his upper lip.

He scans the room. Hunting trophies on the walls. Competition ribbons. Family photos.

LIAM
(muttering)
Some fortress.

He draws his hunting knife. Moves deeper into the house.

INT. REEVES HOUSE - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Hank waits around a corner. He can hear Liam's footsteps. Closer. Closer.

Liam rounds the corner—

Hank STRIKES. The sai catches Liam's knife arm, trapping the blade between its prongs. TWISTS.

The knife clatters to the floor.

Liam throws a wild punch. Hank ducks, drives the sai's blunt end into Liam's ribs.

LIAM
(gasping)
The fuck—

Hank presses the attack. Controlled. Efficient. A lamp SHATTERS as Liam stumbles backward.

Hank hesitates—looks at the broken lamp. His house. His things.

That hesitation costs him.

Liam grabs a CHAIR. Swings it like a bat.

CRACK. It connects with Hank's shoulder. He staggers.

Liam grabs a BOOKSHELF. Pulls it down on top of Hank. Books, photos, trophies crash everywhere.

Hank shoves through the debris. Bleeding from a cut on his forehead now.

LIAM
(breathing hard)
This wasn't supposed to be this hard.

Hank doesn't respond. He's up, sai raised, closing distance.

They clash again. Hank is faster, more skilled—but Liam fights DIRTY. An elbow to the throat. A knee to the groin. He grabs a FIREPLACE POKER, swings wildly.

Hank blocks with the sai but the impact jars his wounded hand. He SCREAMS through gritted teeth.

Liam presses. Smashes a VASE over Hank's head. Hank drops to one knee.

LIAM
(exhausted, frustrated)
Just... fucking... DIE.

Hank surges up—headbutts Liam AGAIN. Liam's already-broken nose CRUNCHES.

Liam howls. Staggers backward. Hank raises the sai for a killing blow—

Liam throws DIRT from a toppled plant into Hank's eyes.

Hank swings blind. Misses.

Liam tackles him. They crash through a COFFEE TABLE. Rolling. Punching. Gouging.

Hank gets on top. Wraps his hands around Liam's throat—but his wounded hand can't grip. The belt loosens. Blood flows.

Liam reaches out. Finds a BROKEN TABLE LEG. Jagged end.

He DRIVES it into Hank's side.

Hank gasps. Looks down at the wood jutting from his torso.

He slumps off Liam. Lands on his back. The sai falls from his grip.

INT. REEVES HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Both men lie in the wreckage, gasping.

Liam sits up first. Wipes blood from his face. Crawls to where Hank's gun landed in the bushes earlier—no. It's gone.

He spots it across the room. Must have come in through the window with him.

He drags himself to it. Picks it up.

Hank lies on the floor. Breathing wet, ragged. The table leg still in his side. He's not getting up.

Liam staggers over. Stands above him.

LIAM
Good game.

Hank looks up at him. No fear. Just exhaustion.

HANK
(barely audible)
My family. They're not part of this.

LIAM
(shaking his head)
I've got no interest in your family, Hank. They're not the challenge.

He aims the gun.

LIAM
You were.

BANG.

Hank's body goes still.

Liam stands there, swaying. Blood dripping from a dozen wounds. He looks around at the destroyed room.

LIAM
(to himself)
Fuck.

He starts to move toward the door—

HEADLIGHTS sweep across the walls through the broken windows.

A car pulling up the driveway.

Liam freezes.

## Production Notes
[Placeholder for animation requirements, technical considerations]
- Violence should be visceral—injuries matter, exhaustion matters
- Show Hank's near-victories to establish him as a formidable opponent
- Hunting awards visible as ironic foreshadowing
