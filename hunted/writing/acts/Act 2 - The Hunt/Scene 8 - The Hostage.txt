## FULL SCRIPT

EXT. REEVES DRIVEWAY - DUSK

SARAH's SUV pulls up the driveway. The house looks dark. Wrong.

SARAH
(to herself)
Why aren't the lights on?

The car stops. OLIVIA (10) unbuckles first, already opening her door.

SARAH
Olivia, wait—

But Olivia's out, running toward the front door. EMMA (12) follows. ELI (18) trails behind them, headphones around his neck.

OLIVIA
Dad! We're home!

The front door is ajar. Olivia pushes through.

Sarah's blood runs cold. She scrambles out of the car.

SARAH
KIDS! STOP!

INT. REEVES HOUSE - FOYER - CONTINUOUS

Olivia freezes two steps inside. Emma bumps into her.

The living room is DESTROYED. Furniture shattered. Glass everywhere.

And in the hallway—HANK. Motionless. Blood pooled beneath him.

EMMA
(screaming)
DAD!

Eli pulls Emma back. His face goes white.

A HAND clamps over Olivia's mouth. LIAM emerges from the shadows, knife to her throat.

LIAM
Nobody move.

Sarah reaches the doorway. Sees her husband's body. Sees her daughter in a killer's grip.

Her face cycles through grief, horror, rage—then settles into something cold.

SARAH
Let her go.

LIAM
I'm walking out of here. She comes with me to the car. Then I let her go.

Sarah's eyes flick to Hank's body. Back to Liam.

SARAH
If you ever come back, you're dead.

Liam smiles. Blood still crusted on his broken nose.

LIAM
I already got what I came for.

SARAH
Then I'll have to come for you.

Something flickers in Liam's eyes. Interest. Challenge.

LIAM
I'd like that.

He backs toward the door, Olivia still in his grip. Sarah doesn't move. Eli holds Emma, both frozen.

At the threshold, Liam shoves Olivia forward—

And sprays BEAR MACE into the room.

Sarah screams. Eyes burning. She reaches blindly—finds Hank's gun on the floor nearby.

She FIRES. Once. Twice. Three times. Wild shots into the darkness.

EXT. REEVES HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Liam sprints across the open ground toward the treeline. A bullet splinters wood near his head. He doesn't slow.

He vanishes into the trees.

INT. REEVES HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Sarah drops to her knees, still half-blind. Olivia crashes into her, sobbing. Emma and Eli pile on.

Sarah holds them. All of them. Eyes streaming, staring at the darkness beyond the shattered windows.

SARAH
(whispered)
I'll find you.

## Production Notes
[Placeholder for animation requirements, technical considerations]
- The exchange dialogue is key—must land with weight
- Sarah's face-to-face with Liam awakens something primal
- Transition from day to dusk during this scene
