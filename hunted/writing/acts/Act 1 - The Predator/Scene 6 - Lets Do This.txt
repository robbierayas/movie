## FULL SCRIPT

EXT. REEVES PROPERTY - DAY

Liam watches from the treeline. Binoculars up.

The driveway is empty. Hank's truck is gone—still at work. The house sits quiet.

                    LIAM (V.O.)
          Mid-afternoon. He's at work. House is empty.

A beat. Then—SARAH's SUV turns off the main road. Pulls up the driveway.

                    LIAM (V.O.)
          There's the wife. School pickup.

SARAH emerges from the driver's side. EMMA and OLIVIA pile out of the back, bickering about something. ELI climbs out last,
headphones on. They head inside.

Liam waits. Watches.

Ten minutes later, the FRONT DOOR opens again. Sarah emerges, keys in hand. The kids follow.

                    LIAM (V.O.)
          And there they go.

They load back into the SUV. Doors slam. Engine starts.

The SUV pulls down the driveway. Disappears onto the main road.

The house is empty now.

                    LIAM (V.O.)
          He'll be home soon. Alone.

INT. LIAM'S APARTMENT - DAY

Liam stands before a bed covered in gear. BLACK CLOTHING. A HUNTING KNIFE. ROPE. BEAR MACE. ZIP TIES.

He dresses methodically. Black pants. Black long-sleeve shirt. Dark jacket.

                    LIAM (V.O.)
          I've thought about this moment for weeks. Every detail. Every contingency.

He loads items into a BLACK DUFFEL BAG. The bear mace goes in last.

                    LIAM (V.O.)
          He's good. Maybe even great. But I'm better.

EXT. REEVES PROPERTY - DUSK

The sun sets behind the treeline. Orange light fades to purple.

Liam's sedan is parked on a side road, hidden from view. He walks through the woods toward the property, duffel over his
shoulder.

                    LIAM (V.O.)
          The wife won't be back for hours. The kids have practice. It's just us.

He reaches his usual observation point. Crouches. Watches.

Hank's truck pulls up the driveway. Parks. Hank climbs out, work boots heavy on the gravel. He grabs a lunchbox from the
passenger seat and heads inside.

The front door closes.

Lights flicker on inside the house.

EXT. REEVES PROPERTY - NIGHT

Full dark now. The house glows. Liam pulls BLACK LEATHER GLOVES from his pocket.

He slides them on. Flexes his fingers.

                    LIAM (V.O.)
          Let's do this.

He steps out of the treeline and moves toward the house.

THE VOICEOVER ENDS.

## Production Notes
[Placeholder for animation requirements, technical considerations]
- End of voiceover is significant—mark the shift
- Liam's approach should feel predatory
- Establish the property's layout before the action begins
