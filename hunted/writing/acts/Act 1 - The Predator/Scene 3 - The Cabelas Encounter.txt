# Scene 3 - The Cabela's Encounter

## LOCATION
INT. CABELA'S - DAY

## CHARACTERS
Liam, Hank, Bobby

## SCENE LAYOUT

### Opening
Liam enters Cabela's, voiceover still running. He's looking for something specific: worthy prey.

### Key Beats
1. Liam observes customers, dismissing them as unworthy. Voiceover explains different things wrong with them.
2. He spots Hank—a man clearly in his element among survival gear- and his friend. Friend also resembles REGULAR CUSTOMER
but more redneck, so Liam gravitates to choosing him. Voiceover begins sizing him up. Hank walks through talking loudly
with his friend as they browse.
3. Hank is knowledgeable, confident, comfortable with the equipment. The friend points out a gun saying "pray and spray".
Hank says yeah that's nice but not for me. Friend says oh yeah karate man. Hank laughs and says guns are fine but knives
are better close up. Seeing Liam by the knives, he says "like my man over there"
4. Voiceover: "This is the one. I've been too overconfident to now. I can't risk a bullet to the face first thing. First
the knife man then the gun man."
5. Liam follows Hank to the parking lot
6. Gets Hank's license plate, begins tracking him home

### Character Moments
- **Liam**: Predator selecting prey. Clinical, excited, certain.
- **Hank**: Unaware he's being watched. His competence and warmth are on display—the very thing that makes him a target.
- **Bobby**: Crass and unfiltered with his friend, enthusiastic about guns, provides contrast to Hank's knife expertise.

### Closing
Liam follows at a distance as Hank drives toward the Reeves property.

## FULL SCRIPT

INT. CABELA'S - DAY

The massive outdoor retailer sprawls before us. Taxidermied animals mounted on walls. Rows of camping gear, fishing
equipment, firearms behind glass. A hunter's paradise.

Liam enters, hands in pockets. He looks like every other weekend warrior browsing—unremarkable. Invisible.

                    LIAM (V.O.)
          After Zaroff, I knew what I needed. Someone with skill. Real skill. Someone who could actually fight back.

He drifts through the aisles, eyes scanning customers. A HEAVYSET MAN examines a tent, struggling with the display model.

                    LIAM (V.O.)
          Not him. Couldn't outrun a head start.

A YOUNG GUY in tactical gear poses for a selfie with a crossbow.

                    LIAM (V.O.)
          All the gear, none of the skill. Probably never left the suburbs.

An ELDERLY COUPLE debates fishing rod prices. Liam giggles to himself looking at them.

Liam pauses near the knife display, pretending to examine a hunting blade. His eyes continue scanning.

                    LIAM (V.O.)
          It seems like hunting for who I am gonna hunt is gonna be the biggest hunt of all. It's all right. Probably need to wait the heat to cool off anyway

LOUD LAUGHTER booms from across the store—the kind of laugh that makes strangers smile. Two men round the corner into the
camping section.

Hank REEVES (early 40s) has the build of a thinner, younger John Goodman—big frame, presence that fills the aisle. His
FRIEND BOBBY trails behind him—soft around the middle, patchy beard, camo jacket even though they're indoors.

                    LIAM (V.O.)
          Now that's interesting.

Hank moves through the store like he owns it. Not arrogant—comfortable. He knows where everything is.

                    HANK
          —and she's standing there, covered in mud, holding this tiny fish like it's a trophy marlin.

Bobby, cackling.

                    BOBBY
          No shit?

                    HANK
          Hand to God. Olivia goes, "Daddy, I caught dinner." Thing was maybe four inches.

                    BOBBY
          Please tell me you ate it.

                    HANK
          Hell yes we ate it. Breaded it, fried it up. She was so damn proud. Sarah had to cut it in pieces so everyone
          could have a bite.

Bobby shakes his head, grinning. Liam drifts closer, keeping displays between them.

                    BOBBY
          Man, your kids are something else. Mine just stare at their phones.

                    HANK
          You gotta get 'em outside, Bobby. Drag 'em if you have to.

                    BOBBY
          Yeah, yeah. Hey, you see the game last night?

                    HANK
          Didn't catch it. Had the girls helping me reinforce the chicken coop. That fox has been circling again.

                    BOBBY
          You and that damn fox. Just shoot it already.

                    HANK
          Where's the sport in that? Besides, I want the kids to figure out the problem. Eli rigged up a motion sensor
          last week. Thing goes off, lights up the whole yard.

Bobby laughs.

                    BOBBY
          Next you'll have 'em digging trenches.

                    HANK
          Already got a bunker.

Bobby stops walking.

                    BOBBY
          Wait, for real?

Hank, winking.

                    HANK
          Storm shelter. Tornado country, Bobby. You know that.

                    BOBBY
          Uh huh. "Storm shelter."

Bobby stops at a display of emergency rations, picks one up.

                    BOBBY
          How long do these things last anyway?

                    HANK
          Those? Twenty-five years if you store 'em right. Temperature controlled, low humidity.

He takes the package from Bobby, examines the seal with practiced eyes.

                    HANK
          This brand's decent. Not the best sodium content, but the calorie density is solid. I got a rotation system at
          home—first in, first out. Never eat anything older than ten years.

                    BOBBY
          Jesus, Hank. You expecting the apocalypse?

                    HANK
          I'm expecting nothing. That's the whole point.

He sets the package back, straightens the display without thinking about it.

                    HANK
          My grandfather told me something once. "The time to fix the roof is when the sun is shining."

                    BOBBY
          That's some fortune cookie shit right there.

Hank laughs.

                    HANK
          JFK said it, asshole.

                    LIAM (V.O.)
          Listen to him. He's not guessing. He knows.

They move toward the firearms section. Liam follows at a distance, pausing to examine a camping stove.

The FIREARMS COUNTER stretches across the back wall. Rifles, shotguns, handguns gleaming under fluorescent lights.
Bobby's eyes go wide.

                    BOBBY
          Oh hell yes. Now we're talking.

He practically jogs to the display, pointing at a tactical shotgun with an extended magazine.

                    BOBBY
          Look at this beautiful bastard. Pray and spray, baby. Pray and spray.

                    HANK
          That's nice.

                    BOBBY
          Nice? This thing could stop a bear.

                    HANK
          So could a .45. So could a crossbow. So could a sharpened stick if you know where to put it.

                    BOBBY
          Here we go.

                    HANK
          I'm just saying—

Bobby, mock announcer voice.

                    BOBBY
          Ladies and gentlemen, Mister Karate Man is about to tell us why his bare hands are better than firearms.

Hank laughs, that booming sound again.

                    HANK
          Not my bare hands. Knives.

                    BOBBY
          The hell is the difference?

                    HANK
          About eight inches of steel.

He moves toward the knife display. Bobby follows, still glancing back at the shotgun longingly.

                    HANK
          Look, guns are fine. I got three at home. But close quarters? Home invasion? Knife's better.

                    BOBBY
          Bullshit.

                    HANK
          Knife doesn't jam.

                    BOBBY
          Neither does a Glock.

                    HANK
          Knife doesn't run out of ammo.

                    BOBBY
          That's what extended mags are for.

                    HANK
          Knife doesn't make noise that tells everyone in a mile radius where you are and that you're fighting for your
          life.

Bobby opens his mouth. Closes it.

                    HANK
          And in tight spaces—hallway, doorway, around a corner—

He makes a quick, efficient gesture with his hand.

                    HANK
          —you can't miss. Gun, you gotta aim. Knife, you just move.

                    BOBBY
          Alright, alright. I still say you're crazy.

Hank picks up a hunting knife, tests the balance.

                    HANK
          Sarah thought so too. Then I taught her. Now she's better than me with a blade.

                    BOBBY
          No way.

                    HANK
          Way. Faster hands. Lower center of gravity. She'd gut you before you knew she was there.

Bobby laughs nervously.

                    BOBBY
          Remind me to never piss off your wife.

Hank spots Liam examining knives nearby. Their eyes meet.

Hank nods.

                    HANK
          Hey, my man over there gets it. Look at him—he's not just browsing. He's testing the weight, checking the edge.
          That's someone who takes it serious.

Liam looks up, gives a small awkward nod—playing the shy customer caught eavesdropping.

                    LIAM
          Sorry, couldn't help overhearing. You military?

                    HANK
          Nah. Just practical. You?

                    LIAM
          Just... learning.

Hank nods approvingly, that warm presence radiating out.

                    HANK
          Best time to learn is before you need it. Most people think they'll figure it out when something happens. They
          won't. The time to prepare—

Bobby, muttering.

                    BOBBY
          —is when the sun is shining.

Hank, grinning.

                    HANK
          He's learning.

He claps Bobby on the shoulder hard enough to stagger him.

                    HANK
          Come on, I gotta grab some paracord before Sarah calls wondering where I am.

                    BOBBY
          You're so whipped.

                    HANK
          Happily, brother. Happily.

They head toward another aisle. Liam watches them go.

                    LIAM (V.O.)
          This is the one. He's not pretending. He actually knows what he's doing.

Liam sets down the knife he was holding.

                    LIAM (V.O.)
          The friend... gun guy. Spray and pray. That means panicking and hoping. The knife man though...

Hank picks up a bundle of paracord, tests its strength with a sharp tug. Even from across the store, the confidence in
his hands is obvious.

                    LIAM (V.O.)
          He's the one I want.

EXT. CABELA'S PARKING LOT - DAY

Hank and Bobby exit, bags in hand. They walk toward a WEATHERED PICKUP TRUCK—practical, well-maintained, not flashy.

Bobby pulls out a cigarette, lights it.

                    BOBBY
          Alright, where to next?

                    HANK
          Grocery store. Gotta grab stuff for the cookout.

Bobby groans.

                    BOBBY
          Can't we just get burgers here? They got jerky.

                    HANK
          Jerky's not a cookout, Bobby.

Bobby takes a long drag, exhales.

                    BOBBY
          I don't know how you do it, man. The whole... family thing. You make it look easy.

Hank pauses, looks at his friend.

                    HANK
          It's not easy. It's just worth it.

He claps Bobby on the shoulder.

                    HANK
          Come on. One more stop and then we eat.

They toss their bags in the truck bed. Bobby climbs into the passenger side. Hank takes the wheel.

Thirty feet away, Liam exits the store. Hangs back near a row of cars. Watching.

                    LIAM (V.O.)
          Interesting. They came together.

Hank starts the pickup. Engine turns over.

Liam walks casually to his own car—a bland sedan, forgettable. He pulls out his phone, pretends to check something while
watching Hank's truck pull out of the space.

The license plate is clearly visible.

                    LIAM (V.O.)
          There you are.

He types something into his phone. Then starts his car.

EXT. RURAL ROAD - DAY

Hank's truck drives down a two-lane highway, farmland stretching on either side. Trees lining the road.

Half a mile back, Liam's sedan follows. Patient. Unhurried.

The truck turns off onto a smaller road. A sign reads: PRIVATE PROPERTY - REEVES.

Liam slows. Doesn't follow. Instead, he pulls over to the shoulder.

Through the trees, he catches glimpses of the truck heading up a long driveway toward a distant house.

He pulls out his phone. Takes a photo of the road sign.

                    LIAM (V.O.)
          The knife man lives out here. Isolated. Property. Family.

He puts the car in gear and drives past the driveway, continuing down the main road.

                    LIAM (V.O.)
          Perfect.
