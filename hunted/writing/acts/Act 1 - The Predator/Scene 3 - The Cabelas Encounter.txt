# Scene 3 - The Cabela's Encounter

## LOCATION
INT. CABELA'S - DAY

## CHARACTERS
Liam, Hank

## SCENE LAYOUT

### Opening
Liam enters Cabela's, voiceover still running. He's looking for something specific: worthy prey.

### Key Beats
1. Liam observes customers, dismissing them as unworthy. Voiceover explains different things wrong with them.
2. He spots Hank—a man clearly in his element among survival gear- and his friend. Friend also resembles REGULAR CUSTOMER but more redneck, so Liam gravitates to choosing him. Voiceover begins sizing him up. Hank walks through talking loudly with his friend as they browse.
3. Hank is knowledgeable, confident, comfortable with the equipment. The friend points out a gun saying "pray and spray". Hank says yeah that's nice but not for me. Friend says oh yeah karate man. Hank laughs and says guns are fine but knives are better close up. Seeing Liam by the knives, he says "like my man over there"
4. Voiceover: "This is the one. I've been too overconfident to now. I can't risk a bullet to the face first thing. First the knife man then the gun man."
5. Liam follows Hank to the parking lot
6. Gets Hank's license plate, begins tracking him home

### Character Moments
- **Liam**: Predator selecting prey. Clinical, excited, certain.
- **Hank**: Unaware he's being watched. His competence is on display—the very thing that makes him a target.

### Closing
Liam follows at a distance as Hank drives toward the Reeves property.

## FULL SCRIPT

INT. CABELA'S - DAY

The massive outdoor retailer sprawls before us. Taxidermied animals mounted on walls. Rows of camping gear, fishing equipment, firearms behind glass. A hunter's paradise.

LIAM enters, hands in pockets. He looks like every other weekend warrior browsing—unremarkable. Invisible.

LIAM (V.O.)
After Zaroff, I knew what I needed. Skill. Real skill. Someone who could actually fight back.

He drifts through the aisles, eyes scanning customers. A HEAVYSET MAN examines a tent, struggling with the display model.

LIAM (V.O.)
Not him. Couldn't outrun a shopping cart.

An ELDERLY COUPLE debates fishing rod prices.

LIAM (V.O.)
Them? Please.

A YOUNG GUY in tactical gear poses for a selfie with a crossbow.

LIAM (V.O.)
All the gear, none of the skill. Probably never left the suburbs.

Liam pauses near the knife display, pretending to examine a hunting blade. His eyes continue scanning.

LOUD LAUGHTER from across the store. Two men enter the camping section—HANK REEVES (early 40s, built like he actually uses his muscles) and his FRIEND BOBBY (similar age, softer, resembles the Regular Customer but more rural).

LIAM (V.O.)
Now that's interesting.

Hank moves through the store like he owns it. Not arrogant—comfortable. He knows where everything is. Bobby trails behind, picking things up and putting them down randomly.

Liam drifts closer, keeping displays between them.

BOBBY
You see the game last night?

HANK
Didn't catch it. Had the girls helping me reinforce the chicken coop.

BOBBY
Man, you got those kids doing everything. Next you'll have 'em digging a bunker.

HANK
(laughs)
Already got one.

Bobby stops at a display of emergency rations.

BOBBY
Hey, how long do these things last?

HANK
Those? Twenty-five years if you store 'em right. Temperature controlled, low humidity. I got a rotation system—first in, first out.

He picks up a package, examines the seal.

HANK
This brand's decent. Not the best sodium content but the calorie density is solid.

LIAM (V.O.)
Listen to him. He's not guessing. He knows.

Bobby shrugs, puts it back. They move toward the firearms section. Liam follows at a distance, pausing to examine a camping stove.

The FIREARMS COUNTER stretches across the back wall. Rifles, shotguns, handguns gleaming under fluorescent lights. Bobby's eyes go wide like a kid at Christmas.

BOBBY
Oh hell yes.

He points at a tactical shotgun with an extended magazine.

BOBBY
Now that's what I'm talking about. Pray and spray, baby.

HANK
Yeah, that's nice.

BOBBY
You should get one.

HANK
Not really my style.

BOBBY
(grinning)
Oh right, right. Mister Karate Man over here.

Hank chuckles, shakes his head.

HANK
Guns are fine. Don't get me wrong. But close quarters? Knife's better.

BOBBY
The hell it is.

HANK
Knife doesn't jam. Doesn't run out of ammo. Doesn't make noise that brings more trouble. And in tight spaces—

He makes a quick, efficient gesture.

HANK
—you can't miss.

Bobby rolls his eyes good-naturedly. Hank glances toward the knife display—and spots Liam examining blades nearby.

HANK
(nodding toward Liam)
Like my man over there. He gets it.

Liam looks up. Their eyes meet. He gives a small, awkward nod—playing the part of the shy customer caught eavesdropping.

LIAM
Sorry, couldn't help overhearing. You military?

HANK
Nah. Just practical. You?

LIAM
Just... learning.

Hank nods approvingly.

HANK
Best time to learn is before you need it.

He claps Bobby on the shoulder.

HANK
Come on, I gotta grab some paracord before Sarah calls wondering where I am.

They head toward another aisle. Liam watches them go.

LIAM (V.O.)
This is the one. He's not pretending. He's actually dangerous.

Liam sets down the knife he was holding.

LIAM (V.O.)
But I've been overconfident before. Can't risk a bullet to the face first thing.

His eyes track Bobby, then return to Hank.

LIAM (V.O.)
The gun man's too scared. Spray and pray means hide and live. But the knife man...

Hank picks up a bundle of paracord, tests its strength with a sharp tug.

LIAM (V.O.)
First him. Then if his friend's around, him too.

EXT. CABELA'S PARKING LOT - DAY

Hank and Bobby exit, bags in hand. They walk toward a WEATHERED PICKUP TRUCK—practical, well-maintained, not flashy.

Liam exits thirty seconds later. Hangs back near a row of cars.

Hank tosses his bags in the truck bed. Says something to Bobby that makes him laugh. They do that handshake-to-hug thing men do.

Bobby heads toward a different vehicle—a newer SUV.

LIAM (V.O.)
Separate cars. Interesting.

Hank climbs into the pickup. Engine turns over.

Liam walks casually to his own car—a bland sedan, forgettable. He pulls out his phone, pretends to check something while watching Hank's truck pull out of the space.

The license plate is clearly visible.

LIAM (V.O.)
There you are.

He types something into his phone. Then starts his car.

EXT. RURAL ROAD - DAY

Hank's truck drives down a two-lane highway, farmland stretching on either side. Trees lining the road.

Half a mile back, Liam's sedan follows. Patient. Unhurried.

LIAM (V.O.)
Everyone thinks predators are fast. Chase down their prey. But the best predators? They're patient. They watch. They learn.

The truck turns off onto a smaller road. A sign reads: PRIVATE PROPERTY - REEVES.

Liam slows. Doesn't follow. Instead, he pulls over to the shoulder.

Through the trees, he catches glimpses of the truck heading up a long driveway toward a distant house.

LIAM (V.O.)
They wait until they know everything about their prey. Every habit. Every weakness.

He pulls out his phone. Takes a photo of the road sign.

LIAM (V.O.)
Every strength.

He puts the car in gear and drives past the driveway, continuing down the main road.

LIAM (V.O.)
The knife man lives out here. Isolated. Thinks he's safe.

A small smile crosses his face.

LIAM (V.O.)
Perfect.
