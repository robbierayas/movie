# Scene 2 - Bar Revenge

## LOCATION
EXT. BAR / STREET ALLEY - NIGHT

## CHARACTERS
Liam, Look-alike Victim

## SCENE LAYOUT

### Opening
Voiceover continues. Liam reflects on what happened next—hunting down a look-alike that same night.

### Key Beats
1. Liam walking down the street, following someone who looks similar to REGULAR CUSTOMER in scene 1 walking with another
group, but is obviously different person because of glasses. He is not trying to hide his presence.
2. Voiceover describes why Liam has to prove himself. If he just lets himself gets pushed around, he will get nowhere, so
he has to make a stand for himself and put people in their place. He's not going to boss anyone around. That would make
him just as unskilled. He is going to improve his skills.
3. As victim continues walking, he goes off on his own. Liam starts using shadows to avoid being seen. Victim is more
cautious looking over shoulder. When he passes alley, he looks but doesnt see Liam and stops. Liam comes from alley
shadows as fight starts.
4. Liam punches victim to ground. Victim offers wallet. Voiceover describes how everyone says that, like skill is
something to be bought not fought for. But he'll give him a chance to show if he has skill.
5. Victim sprays mace at Liam but it gets them both. Liam takes a few blows while recovering, but is able to finish the
kill. He grabs victims glasses and bag.
6. Liam stores the glasses from his second kill as a trophy
7. We glimpse a hair bow—trophy from his first kill (unseen, unexplained)
8. Liam pulls "The Most Dangerous Game" out of the page and reads rubbing his aching eyes. Voiceover resumes: Liam
explains he's finished reading "The Most Dangerous Game"
9. The idea takes hold: he has not been improving his skills at all with these outings. he wants a real challenge—someone
who can fight back

### Character Moments
- **Liam**: The kill is displaced rage—wrong target, same satisfaction. The trophies reveal this isn't his first time.

### Closing
Voiceover establishes the new goal: worthy prey. The hunt for a real challenge begins.

## FULL SCRIPT

EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET - NIGHT (FLASHBACK CONTINUES)

City lights reflect off wet pavement. LIAM walks with purpose, hands in his jacket pockets. Twenty feet ahead, a group of
FOUR PEOPLE laugh and stumble together. Among them—a MAN WITH GLASSES who bears a passing resemblance to the Regular
Customer.

Liam doesn't hide. He walks like any other pedestrian.

LIAM (V.O.)
So we play a little game. Obviously, I would like to test that regular asshat, but this will have to do. The most
important part of my game is not getting caught. So I'll teach this chump.

The Man With Glasses says something that makes the group laugh. He adjusts his glasses—a nervous habit.

The group pauses at a crosswalk. Liam stops too, maintaining distance. The Man With Glasses glances back—just a casual
look, nothing suspicious.

LIAM (V.O.)
I have to make a stand. Put people in their place. But I'm not going to boss anyone around. That would make me just as
unskilled as them.

The light changes. The group crosses.

EXT. SIDE STREET - CONTINUOUS

The group reaches a corner. Hugs. Goodbyes. The Man With Glasses waves them off and turns down a quieter side street,
alone now, hands in his coat pockets.

Liam rounds the corner. The streetlights here are spaced further apart. Pools of darkness between them.

The Man With Glasses walks faster. Not running. Just... aware.

He glances over his shoulder. The street behind him is empty.

He relaxes slightly. Keeps walking.

Liam emerges from a doorway alcove thirty feet ahead. The Man With Glasses doesn't see him yet—he's looking at his phone.

The Man With Glasses looks up from his phone. Sees Liam walking toward him. Their eyes meet.

Something in Liam's expression makes the man's step falter.

Man with glasses laughs.

                    MAN WITH GLASSES
          Hey, can I help you with something?

Liam doesn't answer. Keeps walking.

                    MAN WITH GLASSES
          Look, I don't want any trouble—

He backs toward an alley entrance. Glances into the darkness—empty. When he looks back, Liam is closer.

                    MAN WITH GLASSES
          I've got money, okay? Is that what you want?

                    LIAM
          Does everyone think skill can be bought?

Liam's fist connects with his jaw. The Man With Glasses goes down hard, glasses skittering across the pavement.

EXT. ALLEY - CONTINUOUS

Liam drags him into the shadows. The Man With Glasses scrambles backward, blood on his lip.

                    MAN WITH GLASSES
          Take it! Take whatever you want!

He fumbles out his wallet, throws it at Liam's feet.

LIAM (V.O.)
They always say that. Like skill is something you can buy.

Liam kicks the wallet aside. Spreads his arms slightly. Waiting.

                    MAN WITH GLASSES
          Please—

The Man With Glasses lunges—not at Liam, but for his bag on the ground. He pulls out a small canister.

MACE.

He sprays wildly. The cloud catches them both. Liam staggers back, eyes burning. The Man With Glasses swings
blindly—connects with Liam's temple. Then his ribs. Then his jaw.

Liam takes the blows. Tears streaming, eyes swelling shut. But he doesn't retreat.

The Man With Glasses winds up for another punch—

Liam catches his wrist. Twists. CRACK.

The man screams. Liam's other hand finds his throat.

The struggle is brief. Desperate. Then still.

Liam kneels there, breathing hard, eyes burning and swollen. He blinks through tears at the body beneath him.

He picks up the man's glasses. Holds them up to the distant streetlight. One lens is cracked.  He pockets the glasses.
Grabs the messenger bag and rifles through it—takes nothing useful, just slings it over his shoulder as he walks deeper
into the alley.

INT. LIAM'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

A small studio. Neat. Impersonal. The only decoration: a wooden box on a shelf.

Liam enters, face swollen, eyes red and watering.

He goes to the shelf. Opens the wooden box with care.

Inside: he places the cracked glasses gently beside—

A HAIR BOW. Pink. Faded. Small enough to belong to a child.

Liam stares at it for a moment. Then closes the box.

He moves to his small table. He dumps the messenger bag on the table. A dog-eared paperback pops out: "THE MOST DANGEROUS
GAME" by Richard Connell.

Liam sits. Rubs his aching eyes. Opens the book to a page near the end.

He reads silently. We see his swollen eyes moving across the text.

He sets the book down. Stares at nothing.

LIAM (V.O.)
I finished the book. And I realized I'd been wasting my time. These people—they don't have skill. They just have luck.
Bad luck.

He glances at the wooden box on the shelf.

LIAM (V.O.)
I need more, a real challenge. Someone with actual skill. Someone dangerous. Someone who can fight back. Zaroff
understood. The only prey worth hunting... is prey that can hunt you back.

Liam closes the book. A small smile forms on his swollen, bruised face.

He looks out his small window at the city lights.

LIAM (V.O.)
Time to find a real challenge.
