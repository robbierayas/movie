# Scene 2 - Bar Revenge

## LOCATION
EXT. BAR / STREET ALLEY - NIGHT

## CHARACTERS
Liam, Look-alike Victim

## SCENE LAYOUT

### Opening
Voiceover continues. Liam reflects on what happened next—hunting down a look-alike that same night.

### Key Beats
1. Liam walking down the street, following someone who looks similar to REGULAR CUSTOMER in scene 1 walking with another group, but is obviously different person because of glasses. He is not trying to hide his presence.
2. Voiceover describes why Liam has to prove himself. If he just lets himself gets pushed around, he will get nowhere, so he has to make a stand for himself and put people in their place. He's not going to boss anyone around. That would make him just as unskilled. He is going to improve his skills.
3. As victim continues walking, he goes off on his own. Liam starts using shadows to avoid being seen. Victim is more cautious looking over shoulder. When he passes alley, he looks but doesnt see Liam and stops. Liam comes from alley shadows as fight starts.
4. Liam punches victim to ground. Victim offers wallet. Voiceover describes how everyone says that, like skill is something to be bought not fought for. But he'll give him a chance to show if he has skill.
5. Victim sprays mace at Liam but it gets them both. Liam takes a few blows while recovering, but is able to finish the kill. He grabs victims glasses and bag.
6. Liam stores the glasses from his second kill as a trophy
7. We glimpse a hair bow—trophy from his first kill (unseen, unexplained)
8. Liam pulls "The Most Dangerous Game" out of the page and reads rubbing his aching eyes. Voiceover resumes: Liam explains he's finished reading "The Most Dangerous Game"
9. The idea takes hold: he has not been improving his skills at all with these outings. he wants a real challenge—someone who can fight back

### Character Moments
- **Liam**: The kill is displaced rage—wrong target, same satisfaction. The trophies reveal this isn't his first time.

### Closing
Voiceover establishes the new goal: worthy prey. The hunt for a real challenge begins.

## FULL SCRIPT

EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET - NIGHT (FLASHBACK CONTINUES)

City lights reflect off wet pavement. LIAM walks with purpose, hands in his jacket pockets. Twenty feet ahead, a group of FOUR PEOPLE laugh and stumble together. Among them—a MAN WITH GLASSES who bears a passing resemblance to the Regular Customer.

Liam doesn't hide. He walks like any other pedestrian.

LIAM (V.O.)
What happened next... I'm not proud of it. But I'm not ashamed either.

The Man With Glasses says something that makes the group laugh. He adjusts his glasses—a nervous habit.

LIAM (V.O.)
See, if I let myself get pushed around, I go nowhere. I stay invisible. I stay behind that bar forever.

The group pauses at a crosswalk. Liam stops too, maintaining distance. The Man With Glasses glances back—just a casual look, nothing suspicious.

LIAM (V.O.)
I have to make a stand. Put people in their place. But I'm not going to boss anyone around. That would make me just as unskilled as them.

The light changes. The group crosses.

LIAM (V.O.)
I'm going to improve my skills.

EXT. SIDE STREET - CONTINUOUS

The group reaches a corner. Hugs. Goodbyes. The Man With Glasses waves them off and turns down a quieter side street, alone now, hands in his coat pockets.

Liam rounds the corner. The streetlights here are spaced further apart. Pools of darkness between them.

The Man With Glasses walks faster. Not running. Just... aware.

He glances over his shoulder. The street behind him is empty.

He relaxes slightly. Keeps walking.

Liam emerges from a doorway alcove thirty feet ahead. The Man With Glasses doesn't see him yet—he's looking at his phone.

LIAM (V.O.)
I wasn't hunting him specifically. He was just... available. Wrong place. Wrong face.

The Man With Glasses looks up from his phone. Sees Liam walking toward him. Their eyes meet.

Something in Liam's expression makes the man's step falter.

MAN WITH GLASSES
(nervous laugh)
Hey, can I help you with something?

Liam doesn't answer. Keeps walking.

MAN WITH GLASSES
Look, I don't want any trouble—

He backs toward an alley entrance. Glances into the darkness—empty. When he looks back, Liam is closer.

MAN WITH GLASSES
I've got money, okay? Is that what you want?

LIAM
Does everyone think skill can be bought?

MAN WITH GLASSES
What?

Liam's fist connects with his jaw. The Man With Glasses goes down hard, glasses skittering across the pavement.

EXT. ALLEY - CONTINUOUS

Liam drags him into the shadows. The Man With Glasses scrambles backward, blood on his lip.

MAN WITH GLASSES
Take it! Take whatever you want!

He fumbles out his wallet, throws it at Liam's feet.

LIAM (V.O.)
They always say that. Like skill is something you can buy. Something you can trade for.

Liam kicks the wallet aside.

LIAM (V.O.)
But I'll give him a chance to show me what he's got.

Liam spreads his arms slightly. Waiting.

MAN WITH GLASSES
Please, I was just getting some—

LIAM
Then come get some.

The Man With Glasses lunges—not at Liam, but for his bag on the ground. He pulls out a small canister.

MACE.

He sprays wildly. The cloud catches them both. Liam staggers back, eyes burning. The Man With Glasses swings blindly—connects with Liam's temple. Then his ribs. Then his jaw.

Liam takes the blows. Tears streaming, eyes swelling shut. But he doesn't retreat.

LIAM (V.O.)
There it is. Some fight in him after all.

The Man With Glasses winds up for another punch—

Liam catches his wrist. Twists. CRACK.

The man screams. Liam's other hand finds his throat.

LIAM (V.O.)
(almost disappointed)
Not enough, though.

The struggle is brief. Desperate. Then still.

Liam kneels there, breathing hard, eyes burning and swollen. He blinks through tears at the body beneath him.

He picks up the man's glasses. Holds them up to the distant streetlight. One lens is cracked.

LIAM (V.O.)
Some people fight. Most don't. But none of them have real skill.

He pockets the glasses. Grabs the messenger bag and rifles through it—takes nothing useful, just slings it over his shoulder as he walks deeper into the alley.

INT. LIAM'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

A small studio. Neat. Impersonal. The only decoration: a wooden box on a shelf.

Liam enters, face swollen, eyes red and watering. He drops the messenger bag on the floor.

He goes to the shelf. Opens the wooden box with care.

Inside: the cracked glasses. He places them gently beside—

A HAIR BOW. Pink. Faded. Small enough to belong to a child.

Liam stares at it for a moment. Then closes the box.

LIAM (V.O.)
That was my second.

He moves to his small table. A dog-eared paperback sits there: "THE MOST DANGEROUS GAME" by Richard Connell.

Liam sits. Rubs his aching eyes. Opens the book to a page near the end.

LIAM (V.O.)
After my eyes recovered, I finished the book. Count Zaroff hunted people for sport. Not because he had to. Because he could.

He reads silently. We see his swollen eyes moving across the text.

LIAM (V.O.)
And I realized something.

He sets the book down. Stares at nothing.

LIAM (V.O.)
I haven't been improving my skills at all. These outings—they're nothing. Random people on dark streets. They don't fight. They beg.

He glances at the wooden box on the shelf.

LIAM (V.O.)
Where's the challenge in that?

He opens the book again to a specific passage. Traces a line with his finger.

LIAM (V.O.)
Zaroff understood. The only prey worth hunting is prey that can hunt you back.

Liam closes the book. A small smile forms on his swollen, bruised face.

LIAM (V.O.)
I need a real challenge. Someone with actual skill. Someone dangerous.

He looks out his small window at the city lights.

LIAM (V.O.)
Someone who can fight back.
