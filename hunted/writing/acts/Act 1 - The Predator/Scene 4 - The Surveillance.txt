## FULL SCRIPT

MONTAGE - SURVEILLANCE (WEEKS PASS)

EXT. RURAL ROAD - NIGHT

Liam's sedan parked in the shadows, fifty yards from the Reeves driveway. He watches through binoculars. The house glows warm in the distance.

LIAM (V.O.)
The knife man has a name. Hank Reeves.

EXT. REEVES PROPERTY - DAY

Liam walks up the driveway in an AMAZON VEST, package in hand. He lingers at the mailbox, rifling through envelopes.

LIAM (V.O.)
Wife—Sarah. Three kids. Two girls, one boy.

He photographs the mail with his phone. Slides it back. Walks away.

LIAM (V.O.)
If I want Hank, I'll have to get him alone.

EXT. REEVES PROPERTY - DUSK

Liam crouches in the treeline with binoculars. Through the windows: TAXIDERMIED DEER HEADS on the walls. HUNTING PHOTOS. COMPETITION RIBBONS.

LIAM (V.O.)
So he does hunt. The liar.

A beat.

LIAM (V.O.)
Said he wasn't military. Just "practical." He's been hunting his whole life.

EXT. REEVES PROPERTY - VARIOUS TIMES

Quick cuts: SARAH's car pulls in, kids piling out with backpacks. EMMA and OLIVIA chase each other in the yard. ELI loads archery gear into the truck. Sarah herds them back into the car for practice.

LIAM (V.O.)
Kids have activities. Wife drives them. House sits empty for hours.

Hank's truck pulls up the driveway. Alone. Work clothes dusty.

LIAM (V.O.)
But Hank comes home from work. Alone.

EXT. REEVES PROPERTY - DAY

Liam walks the perimeter at a distance, sketching in a small notebook. He notes windows, doors, the open ground surrounding the house.

LIAM (V.O.)
Three floors—basement, main, upstairs. Long sightlines from the second story. No cover approaching the house.

He pauses. Studies the roofline.

LIAM (V.O.)
He built this place like a fortress. Smart. But I'll come from outside. Catch him before he gets in.

INT. LIAM'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Liam sits at his small table. PHOTOS spread out—the house, the family, Hank's truck. A hand-drawn SCHEDULE. A crude MAP of the property.

He circles something on the schedule. Leans back.

LIAM (V.O.)
Now I know everything I need.

He looks at Hank's photo.

LIAM (V.O.)
Time to hunt.

## Production Notes
- Voiceover continues throughout montage
- Show meticulous planning but NOT hacking—physical surveillance only
- Contrast Liam's cramped apartment with the Reeves' large property
- End montage with sense of completion: he knows everything he needs
