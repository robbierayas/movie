## FULL SCRIPT

EXT. REEVES PROPERTY - DAY

Liam watches from the treeline. Binoculars up.

The FRONT DOOR opens. SARAH emerges, keys in hand. EMMA and OLIVIA follow, bickering about something. ELI trails behind, headphones on.

LIAM (V.O.)
There they go.

Sarah loads the kids into her SUV. Doors slam. The engine starts.

The SUV pulls down the driveway. Disappears onto the main road.

Hank's truck is NOT in the driveway. Still at work.

LIAM (V.O.)
He'll be home soon. Alone.

INT. LIAM'S APARTMENT - DAY

Liam stands before a bed covered in gear. BLACK CLOTHING. A HUNTING KNIFE. ROPE. BEAR MACE. ZIP TIES.

He dresses methodically. Black pants. Black long-sleeve shirt. Dark jacket.

LIAM (V.O.)
I've thought about this moment for weeks. Every detail. Every contingency.

He loads items into a BLACK DUFFEL BAG. The bear mace goes in last.

LIAM (V.O.)
He's good. Maybe even great. But I'm better.

EXT. REEVES PROPERTY - DUSK

The sun sets behind the treeline. Orange light fades to purple.

Liam's sedan is parked on a side road, hidden from view. He walks through the woods toward the property, duffel over his shoulder.

LIAM (V.O.)
The wife won't be back for hours. The kids have practice. It's just us.

He reaches his usual observation point. Crouches. Watches.

Hank's truck pulls up the driveway. Parks. Hank climbs out, work boots heavy on the gravel. He grabs a lunchbox from the passenger seat and heads inside.

The front door closes.

Lights flicker on inside the house.

EXT. REEVES PROPERTY - NIGHT

Full dark now. The house glows. Liam pulls BLACK LEATHER GLOVES from his pocket.

He slides them on. Flexes his fingers.

LIAM (V.O.)
Let's do this.

He steps out of the treeline and moves toward the house.

THE VOICEOVER ENDS.

## Production Notes
[Placeholder for animation requirements, technical considerations]
- End of voiceover is significant—mark the shift
- Liam's approach should feel predatory
- Establish the property's layout before the action begins
