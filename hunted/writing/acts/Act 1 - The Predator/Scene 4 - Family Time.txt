## SCENE LAYOUT

### Opening
Bobby and Hank's trucks pull up to the Reeves property. Groceries for a cookout.

### Key Beats
1. The family rushes out to greet them. Girly the Rottweiler bounds around excitedly. Everyone's eager to eat.
2. Olivia reminds everyone about "homeschool." The kids look to Hank expectantly.
3. Hank decides: homeschool first, then food. Groans, but no real complaints.
4. "Homeschool" is revealed to be self-defense class taught by Hank in the yard.
5. Kids take turns practicing moves with Hank or on a training dummy. Eli is serious, focused. Emma tries hard. Olivia
giggles through it.
6. Bobby mostly plays with Girly saying "who's the best gorilla", roughhousing on the grass. Olivia says to call her
Girly. Bobby joins in for a demonstration—does something wacky/exaggerated that makes the kids laugh.
7. Sarah watches from the grill, flipping burgers, smiling at her family.
8. After practice, they all sit to eat together. Kids compare their hobbies and talk about school. Laughter, passing
food, the dog begging for scraps.
9. Feeling of warmth, safety, everything is fine.

## FULL SCRIPT

EXT. REEVES PROPERTY - DRIVEWAY - DAY

Two trucks roll up the long driveway. HANK's weathered pickup and BOBBY's SUV.

Before they've even stopped, the front door bursts open.

Olivia sprints across the yard. EMMA follows. ELI walks behind them, trying to look cool.

A ROTTWEILER—GIRLY—bounds out, tail wagging furiously.

                    OLIVIA
          Daddy!

She crashes into Hank as he climbs out. He scoops her up.

                    HANK
          There's my girl!

Bobby emerges from his SUV, grocery bags in hand. Girly immediately redirects, jumping at him.

                    BOBBY
          Hey! Down, you monster. Down!

He's laughing, not actually bothered. Girly ignores him, licking his face.

Sarah appears on the porch, wiping her hands on a towel.

                    SARAH
          You get everything?

                    HANK
          And then some. Bobby insisted on the "good" steaks.

Bobby, hauling bags.

                    BOBBY
          They were on sale!

                    SARAH
          Uh huh.

Emma takes some bags from Bobby. Eli grabs the cooler from Hank's truck bed.

                    EMMA
          Can we eat now? I'm starving.

Olivia, still in Hank's arms.

                    OLIVIA
          Wait! What about homeschool?

Everyone stops. The kids exchange looks.

Hank, sighing theatrically.

                    HANK
          She's right.

                    EMMA
          Dad, come on—

                    ELI
          We can do it after—

                    HANK
          Nope. Your sister's got a point. Homeschool first. Then we eat.

Groans all around. But no one really argues. This is routine.

Bobby turns to Sarah.

                    BOBBY
          Homeschool?

Sarah smiles.

                    SARAH
          You'll see.

EXT. REEVES PROPERTY - BACKYARD - DAY

A TRAINING DUMMY stands in the grass. Padded. Duct-taped. Well-used.

The family forms a loose circle. Hank stands in the center, rolling up his sleeves.

                    HANK
          Alright. Quick review. Eli, show me the disarm.

Eli steps forward. Hank grabs his wrist. In one smooth motion, Eli twists, breaks the grip, and has Hank's arm pinned
behind his back.

Hank, impressed.

                    HANK
          Good. Faster than last time.

                    ELI
          I've been practicing.

                    HANK
          I can tell. Emma, you're up.

Emma approaches nervously. Hank holds up his palms.

                    HANK
          Strike. Solar plexus.

Emma punches. Decent form, but tentative.

                    HANK
          Harder. You're not gonna hurt me.

She tries again. Better.

                    HANK
          Good. Now knee to the groin. Don't hold back.

Emma hesitates, glancing at Olivia.

                    EMMA
          Dad...

                    HANK
          On the dummy, Emma. On the dummy.

Emma, relieved.

                    EMMA
          Oh. Right.

She pivots to the dummy. Delivers a solid knee.

                    HANK
          There you go!

Bobby sits on the grass nearby, Girly sprawled across his lap. He's not really watching—he's roughhousing with the dog.

Bobby, baby-talking to Girly.

                    BOBBY
          Who's the best gorilla? Who's the best gorilla in the whole world?

Girly's tail wags furiously. She licks his face.

Olivia, correcting him.

                    OLIVIA
          Her name is Girly, Uncle Bobby!

                    BOBBY
          I know, I know. But look at her—she's a gorilla. Aren't you, girl?

Girly barks happily.

                    HANK
          Bobby. Get in here.

                    BOBBY
          What? No, I'm good—

                    HANK
          Come show the kids how not to do it.

Bobby groans but gets up. Girly follows, thinking this is a new game.

Bobby turns to the kids.

                    BOBBY
          Alright, watch and learn. This is what happens when you panic.

He throws a wild, exaggerated punch at Hank. Hank sidesteps easily.

Bobby stumbles forward, windmilling his arms.

                    BOBBY
          See? Panic.

The kids laugh. Even Eli cracks a smile.

Bobby throws another haymaker. Hank catches his wrist, spins him, and Bobby ends up face-down in the grass with Hank's
knee on his back.

Hank turns to the kids.

                    HANK
          What did he do wrong?

                    OLIVIA
          Everything!

More laughter. Bobby plays it up, tapping out dramatically.

                    BOBBY
          Okay, okay! I yield! Uncle!

Girly licks his face. Bobby sputters.

Sarah watches from the GRILL, spatula in hand. Smoke rises from sizzling burgers.

She's smiling. This is her family. This is her life.

It's good.

EXT. REEVES PROPERTY - BACKYARD - LATER

The family sits around a weathered PICNIC TABLE. Paper plates piled with burgers, corn, coleslaw.

Bobby's telling a story, gesturing with a burger in hand.

                    BOBBY
          —and he says to me, "Sir, that's not a parking spot." And I say, "It is now!"

Hank laughs, that booming sound. Sarah shakes her head. The kids are giggling.

Under the table, Girly moves between legs, hunting for dropped food. Olivia "accidentally" lets a piece of burger fall.

                    OLIVIA
          I made the travel team!

                    SARAH
          That's wonderful, honey!

                    EMMA
          Show-off.

                    OLIVIA
          You're just mad because you quit gymnastics.

                    EMMA
          I didn't quit. I... graduated.

Eli turns to Emma.

                    ELI
          Pass the ketchup.

                    EMMA
          Say please.

                    ELI
          Please, your highness.

Emma throws a chip at him. He catches it. Eats it.

                    HANK
          What about you, Eli? How's the archery going?

                    ELI
          Good. Coach says I might make varsity next year.

                    BOBBY
          Varsity? Damn, kid. I couldn't hit a barn door at your age.

Hank turns to Bobby.

                    HANK
          You bring Tyler next time. Kid needs to get out.

                    BOBBY
          Yeah, I keep saying that.

                    SARAH
          We'd love to have him. The more the merrier.

Hank puts his arm around Sarah. She leans into him.

The sun is setting behind the trees. Golden light on golden moment.

Everything is fine.

Everything is perfect.

CUT TO BLACK.

## Production Notes
- Establish the family dynamic and warmth before Liam's intrusion
- Show Hank teaching self-defense skills naturally (setup for Act 3)
- Introduce Girly the dog as part of the family
- Bobby's different personality here vs. Scene 3—he code-switches, staying family-appropriate
- This peace makes the violence to come hit harder
