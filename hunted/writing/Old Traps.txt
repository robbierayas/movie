   - Seen in: Home Alone, You're Next, countless others
   - SO overused it's become a cliche
   - Audience expects it the moment they see a doorway
   - If used, must subvert expectations somehow

   - Any swinging object trap reads as "Home Alone reference"

3. Shotgun Behind Door
   - Rigged to fire when door opens

GENERAL PRINCIPLES FROM HOME INVASION FILMS:
---------------------------------------------

1. Home-Field Advantage
   - Defenders know the layout
   - Attackers are disoriented
   - Use familiarity as weapon

2. Improvised Weapons
   - Kitchen knives, tools, household items
   - Anything can be deadly
   - Desperation breeds creativity

3. Traps vs. Direct Confrontation
   - Traps allow weaker defender to hurt stronger attacker
   - Reduce need for physical strength
   - Level the playing field

4. Psychology of Defense
   - Paranoia works both ways
   - Attackers become hesitant
   - Defenders can use fear

5. Escalation
   - Non-lethal becomes lethal
   - Situation spirals
   - Violence begets violence

6. Cost of Violence
   - Defenders are often traumatized
   - Winning doesn't mean unscathed
   - Relevant to Hunted's theme


RELEVANT TO HUNTED:
-------------------
- You're Next: Survivalist protagonist fights home invaders
- Straw Dogs: Passive person driven to violent defense
- The Collector: Trap-focused horror
- Don't Breathe: Defender with home-field advantage
- Home Alone: Ingenuity over strength (but make it lethal)

Key difference: In Hunted, the defenders SET the traps
and WAIT for the attacker to return - not reacting to
surprise attack, but preparing for known threat.
