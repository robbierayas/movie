NOTES FOR TRAP DESIGN:
----------------------
- Traps should use realistic prepper/homesteader materials
- Nothing too sophisticated - these are improvised
- Mix of lethal and non-lethal
- Some traps can be avoided with caution (rewards smart Liam)
- Others should be unavoidable once triggered
- Consider how traps could backfire on defenders
- The trap that wounds both Sarah and Liam should be one she set up
- Reference Home Alone for ingenuity but with lethal intent
- Traps should reflect what Hank taught the family
