# ANNO BOMBINI

## Logline
Two hapless survivors and a resourceful woman journey across a post-nuclear wasteland with a mutant raccoon sidekick, searching for an unlimited power source that turns out to be a live warhead worshipped by the world's dumbest cult.

## Synopsis
Years after atomic war destroyed governments and mutated wildlife, humanity survives in scattered settlements of varying stupidity. In one such community, three hunters—two overconfident idiots and the smart woman stuck babysitting them—stumble upon a signal pointing to an "unlimited power source" that could save their struggling settlement.

Reluctantly appointed as envoys (because "you found it"), they embark on a cross-wasteland journey, encountering a rogues' gallery of survivor groups: preppers who prepared for the wrong apocalypse, a lone hermit with an elaborate defense system against non-existent threats, a cargo cult worshipping dead technology, and rival idiots on the same quest. Along the way, they accidentally adopt an injured mutant raccoon that becomes their unlikely voice of reason—constantly ignored.

Each settlement visit ends in disaster: they release contained mutants, break water filtration systems, shatter religious beliefs, and steal someone's only vehicle. Their trail of destruction is matched only by their obliviousness to the chaos they cause.

Finally reaching the coordinates, they discover an underground bunker where a cult has built an elaborate temple around an active nuclear warhead, interpreting its ticking and beeping as divine messages. Despite warnings from the glowing, radiation-sick cultists, the heroes attempt to "break off a piece" of the "eternal flame," accidentally triggering a 60-second detonation sequence. They escape in slapstick panic while the cult stays behind to witness "the blessing." Watching the mushroom cloud from a safe distance, they return home having learned nothing, ready to spin their catastrophic failure as heroic success.

The twist: In a world rebuilt by idiots, idiocy is the ultimate survival trait.

## Theme
**Stupidity as Survival Strategy**

In the post-apocalyptic wasteland, the smartest move is to be too dumb to realize you're doomed. The film explores how humanity's worst traits—overconfidence, selective memory, and the ability to rationalize anything—might actually be evolutionary advantages when civilization collapses.

## Genre
Dark Comedy / Post-Apocalyptic / Road Trip Adventure

## Setting
**Post-Nuclear America, 15-20 Years After "The Event"**

The landscape is a patchwork of abandoned cities, wilderness reclaiming suburbs, and makeshift settlements. Governments are gone. Currency is barter. Mutant animals roam freely—some harmless, some deadly, all bizarre. The world has regressed to a pre-industrial state, but survivors cling to fragments of the old world: broken technology, half-remembered history, and bureaucratic rituals that no longer serve any purpose.

The tone is absurdist realism—people have adapted to the apocalypse with the same mundane pettiness they brought to pre-war HOA meetings and office politics. Nobody is having a dramatic post-apocalyptic breakdown; they're just annoyed and making do.

**Key Locations:**
- **Home Settlement** - A functioning but dysfunctional community with useless government committees, weird new religions, and HOA-style rules for farming mutant vegetables. Our heroes serve as the town's "hunters" (worst possible choice).
- **The Journey** - Southwest American desert terrain with varied biomes: abandoned suburbs, dried riverbeds, canyon systems, and the skeletal remains of pre-war infrastructure.
- **The Underground Bunker** - A former military installation converted into an elaborate temple around an active nuclear warhead, complete with worshippers touching the casing and interpreting radiation sickness as "divine communion."

## Historical Context (if applicable)
N/A - Fictional post-apocalyptic future

## MAIN CHARACTERS

### Guy 1: "The Leader" - FICTIONAL
Late 20s-early 30s. Overconfident idiot who appointed himself the brains of the operation despite being catastrophically wrong about everything. Takes charge in every situation, makes bold decisions with complete certainty, and somehow never connects his failures to his choices. Physically capable but intellectually doomed. Treats the apocalypse like a team-building exercise he's crushing.

**Arc:** Begins confident, ends confident. Learns absolutely nothing.

### Guy 2: "The Anxious One" - FICTIONAL
Late 20s-early 30s. Neurotic idiot who knows they're all going to die but follows anyway out of loyalty, boredom, or lack of alternatives. Provides running commentary of worst-case scenarios that are somehow less catastrophic than what actually happens. Uses stoner logic to rationalize their choices. The "Smart one" of the two guys (very low bar).

**Arc:** Begins anxious, stays anxious, validated but not vindicated.

### The Girl: "The Competent One" - FICTIONAL
Late 20s. Smart, capable, and cursed with enough responsibility to keep these idiots alive but not enough authority to stop them from making decisions. The audience POV character who also makes bad choices, usually by underestimating just how badly things can go. Functions as the straight man but gets dragged into the stupidity. Has given up on preventing disasters and now just tries to survive them.

**Arc:** Begins competent and frustrated, ends competent and MORE frustrated, but with a raccoon.

### Billy Bumbler (The Raccoon) - FICTIONAL
Mutant raccoon with limited speech ability (repeats last word of sentences like Billy Bumbler from Dark Tower). Smarter than all three humans combined. Provides physical comedy, emotional anchor, and the only voice of reason that nobody listens to. Saves the group multiple times through animal instinct and common sense. Only speaks clearly once in the entire film: calling them "idiots" while watching the mushroom cloud.

**Arc:** Begins as injured creature they "rescue" (actually making it worse), becomes the group's conscience, ends as their only successful acquisition from the entire journey.

## STORY STRUCTURE

### ACT ONE: THE SETTLEMENT
**Timeline:** Day 1 (~10-15 minutes)
**Theme:** Everyone is rebuilding civilization exactly as stupidly as before

The film opens on daily life in the Home Settlement, establishing that the post-apocalypse is banal rather than dramatic. We see government committees accomplishing nothing, people arguing about mutant vegetable farm property lines, someone trying to enforce traffic laws despite no cars, and our three heroes serving as the town's "hunters"—a job they're comically bad at.

**Major Beats:**
- **Settlement Life** - Establish the absurd bureaucracy and petty politics of post-apocalyptic civilization
- **The Hunt** - Our heroes fail spectacularly at hunting, nearly get killed by a mutant creature
- **The Discovery** - They stumble upon a functioning GPS device/radio transmission pointing to coordinates with the message about "unlimited power source"
- **The Town Meeting** - Settlement leader (equally idiotic) insists THEY must go investigate because "you found it"
- **Reluctant Acceptance** - Despite every reason not to go, they agree (Girl needs to protect these idiots, Guy 1 sees glory, Guy 2 has nothing better to do)
- **Departure** - They leave with inadequate supplies and overconfidence

**Act One Climax:** Crossing the settlement boundary into the true wasteland, the camera pulls back to show just how vast and dangerous their journey will be—contrasted with Guy 1's confident "We'll be back by Tuesday."

---

### ACT TWO: THE JOURNEY
**Timeline:** Days 2-6 (~45-50 minutes)
**Theme:** Everyone survived the apocalypse wrong

The bulk of the film is a road trip through absurdity, meeting different survivor groups who each represent a different flavor of post-apocalyptic failure. Each encounter follows the same pattern: arrive, try to help or trade, accidentally make everything worse, escape before consequences catch up.

**Major Sequence 1: The Preppers**
- Arrive at fortified compound designed for zombie apocalypse (wrong disaster)
- Preppers explain their elaborate useless defenses (gas masks, zombie-proof walls)
- Heroes accidentally release the mutant creature they'd safely contained
- Creature eats the prepper's food supply
- Heroes flee while preppers try to use "zombie elimination protocols" on a mutant bear

**Major Sequence 2: The Hermit & The Raccoon**
- Encounter lone survivor with massive trap system defending against threats that don't exist in this region
- Hermit delivers insane monologue about their journey and paranoid preparations
- Hermit has one piece of crucial info about the destination (cult rumors)
- Heroes find injured mutant raccoon, "rescue" it by making injuries worse
- Raccoon begins following them, clearly smarter than all three humans
- Heroes interpret this as "bonding"

**Major Sequence 3: The Cargo Cult**
- Discover settlement worshipping dead Roomba/Alexa as oracle
- Elaborate rituals to make broken technology "speak"
- Priests interpret random beeps and errors as divine guidance
- Heroes need information, must "consult the oracle"
- Guy 1 accidentally destroys the sacred device trying to "fix" it
- Angry mob chase scene, heroes escape with raccoon leading the way

**Major Sequence 4: Rival Idiots**
- Meet mirror-version group also seeking the power source
- Both groups immediately distrust each other despite being equally stupid
- Forced to team up for one obstacle (creature attack or environmental hazard)
- Both sides attempt to betray the other, both betrayals fail
- Rivalry ends in mutual exhaustion, groups part ways
- Heroes "acquire" (steal) the vehicle the rivals were using

**Major Sequence 5: The Big Creature Set-Piece**
- Practical stunt and VFX showcase encounter with major mutant threat
- Raccoon tries to warn them, ignored
- Narrow escape using the vehicle and dumb luck
- Girl's competence saves them despite Guy 1's "leadership"

**Act Two Climax:** They arrive at the coordinates: a collapsed highway overpass concealing a tunnel entrance with faded military warnings. Strange religious symbols painted over radiation hazard signs. They hear chanting from below. Raccoon refuses to enter. They enter anyway.

---

### ACT THREE: THE REVELATION
**Timeline:** Day 7 (~20-25 minutes)
**Theme:** Faith protects you from nothing, especially physics

The final act is the payoff for every stupid decision they've made along the way. They descend into the bunker and discover the truth: the "unlimited power source" is an active nuclear warhead, and the cult worshipping it is in the late stages of radiation poisoning but interprets their sickness as "divine communion."

**Major Beats:**
- **The Temple** - Elaborate religious chamber built around the warhead, cultists performing rituals, high priest "interpreting" the weapon's beeping
- **The Negotiation** - Heroes ask for a piece to bring home; cult warns them it's dangerous; heroes insist it's what they came for
- **The Attempt** - They try to chip off a piece with hand tools while cultists work around them casually
- **The Trigger** - They hit the wrong thing; calm mechanical voice announces "Detonation sequence initiated. 60 seconds."
- **The Escape** - Slapstick sprint through tunnels, bumping into cultists who won't leave to witness "the blessing," raccoon leading the way
- **The Explosion** - They burst out of the tunnel, dive behind rocks, beat of silence, then MASSIVE EXPLOSION
- **The Aftermath** - Mushroom cloud rises; Girl stares in horror; Guy 1 and Guy 2 process what they've done; Raccoon looks at them with judgment
- **The Word** - Raccoon, for the first time, speaks clearly: "Idiots."
- **The Return** - Journey home montage, debating how to explain this

**Epilogue Sequence:**
- They return to Home Settlement, visible mushroom cloud in distance
- Three options for ending:
  - **Option A (Liars):** They claim success, celebrated as heroes, radio chatter asks about explosion
  - **Option B (Honest Idiots):** They explain exactly what happened, town accepts their insane logic somehow
  - **Option C (Sequel Hook):** They return as town leader announces another signal came in, heroes groan

**Final Image:** Wide shot of the settlement with mushroom cloud on distant horizon, life continuing as absurdly as ever, our heroes having learned nothing, ready to fuck up again.

## KEY STORY ELEMENTS

### The Mutant Animals
Not traditional giant monsters—these are animals transformed by radiation into bizarre versions of themselves. Some have minor intelligence boosts (like the raccoon), some are aggressive, some are harmless but weird. The key is they're treated as mundane by survivors—just another part of the landscape. Visual comedy comes from characters casually navigating around dangerous creatures like they're avoiding potholes.

### The Settlements' Stupidity Spectrum
Each group represents a different way humans fail to adapt:
- **Preppers** - Over-prepared for wrong scenario
- **Hermit** - Paranoid about non-existent threats
- **Cargo Cult** - Misunderstanding technology as magic
- **Rival Group** - Competent enough to be dangerous, too dumb to succeed
- **Nuke Cult** - Fatally committed to provably wrong beliefs

This creates a thesis: humanity's survival wasn't about the smartest or strongest, but the ones too stupid to give up.

### The Raccoon's Intelligence
Billy Bumbler serves as the film's conscience and the only competent character. His limited speech (repeating last words) makes him seem cute and harmless, but his actions consistently demonstrate better judgment than any human. The joke is that nobody listens to the smartest member of the group because he's a raccoon. His ONE moment of clear speech ("Idiots") is the film's thesis statement.

### The Vehicle
A post-apocalyptic junker car they steal from the rival group. Barely functional, held together by duct tape and prayer, but becomes their most valuable asset. Represents their entire approach: stolen, barely working, somehow gets them where they need to go.

### The Warhead as God
The cult's belief system is both horrifying and hilarious. They've built elaborate theology around a weapon of mass destruction, interpreting its ticking/beeping as divine messages, touching it in rituals despite radiation burns, and treating their sickness as "being blessed by the eternal flame." They're aware it's dangerous but believe faith protects them. This is the film's ultimate joke: blind faith versus physics. Physics wins.

### The Trail of Destruction
Every location the heroes visit is worse off after they leave. This isn't malicious—they genuinely try to help or trade fairly—but their combination of incompetence and overconfidence makes them agents of chaos. By the climax, the audience is primed for catastrophe.

## DRAMATIC THEMES

1. **Stupidity as Evolutionary Advantage** - In a world this broken, overthinking gets you killed; underthinking gets you lucky.
2. **Humanity Learns Nothing** - We'll rebuild civilization with the same flaws that destroyed it.
3. **Blind Faith vs. Observable Reality** - Belief doesn't protect you from physics, radiation, or consequences.
4. **The Competent Are Cursed** - Being the smart one just means you see the disaster coming and can't stop it.
5. **Chaos Agents** - Some people make everything worse without meaning to; that's just their natural state.
6. **Post-Apocalyptic Banality** - The end of the world isn't dramatic; it's annoying and bureaucratic.
7. **Nature's Revenge is Weird** - Animals didn't become threatening super-predators; they became bizarre and unpredictable.
8. **Technology as Magic** - When you don't understand how things work, everything seems equally plausible.
9. **No Lessons Learned** - Character growth is a myth; people stay exactly who they are regardless of consequences.

## PRODUCTION NOTES

**Visual Style:**
- Washed-out desert palette (Southwest US locations: New Mexico, Arizona, Utah)
- Contrast between bleak wasteland exteriors and absurdly decorated settlement interiors
- Practical creature effects for raccoon and key mutants; VFX for background creatures and explosion
- Naturalistic lighting—no post-apocalyptic teal/orange; just harsh daylight and campfire nights
- Film references: *Burn After Reading* (dark comedy tone), *Mad Max: Fury Road* (wasteland aesthetic without the action), *What We Do In the Shadows* (deadpan absurdity)

**Key Visuals:**
- Opening shot: Settlement's "government building" (repurposed Walmart) with hand-painted signs
- The heroes walking into wasteland as camera pulls back to show scale
- Cargo cult worshipping Roomba with elaborate altar of extension cords
- Underground temple: religious iconography painted over radiation warnings
- The escape: Slapstick sprint intercut with calm mechanical countdown voice
- Mushroom cloud reflected in the raccoon's knowing eyes
- Final wide shot: Settlement life continues, distant mushroom cloud on horizon

**Music/Sound:**
- Ironic use of upbeat retro music against bleak visuals (like *Fallout* games)
- Diegetic music from broken pre-war tech (radios, speakers)
- The warhead's "divine voice" is just mechanical beeping and status announcements
- Raccoon's chittering and occasional word repetition as comedic punctuation
- Explosion sound design: distant rumble that takes too long to arrive, then rattles everything

**Special Considerations:**
- Raccoon is mix of practical puppet (close-ups, interactions) and trained animal with CG face (movement)
- Mutant creatures should look bizarre but LOW-BUDGET—practical suits and puppetry over CG
- Mushroom cloud is the ONE big VFX shot—everything else is practical
- Vehicle stunts are real junker cars, not CG
- Desert shooting in American Southwest for authentic wasteland feel and tax incentives

**Tone Reference:**
Think *Burn After Reading* meets *Mad Max* by way of *Dumb and Dumber*—catastrophic consequences played for laughs, nobody learns anything, chaos reigns, idiots somehow survive.

## NOTES FOR DEVELOPMENT

**Tone Balance:**
The film needs to walk a tightrope between dark comedy and nihilism. The nuke cult's death should be cathartic (they were warned, they chose this) not tragic. The key is making every victim of the heroes' stupidity ALSO stupid, so we're laughing at systemic failure, not innocent suffering.

**The Raccoon is Critical:**
Billy Bumbler must be charming enough to carry emotional weight (we care about his safety) while being clearly smarter than the humans (we trust his judgment). His limited speech can't feel like a gimmick—it should enhance comedy through timing and repetition callbacks.

**Character Dynamics to Explore:**
- Guy 1 and Guy 2 have known each other long enough to have established stupid-buddy rapport
- The Girl joined their group recently enough to still be frustrated but committed enough to stay
- None of them are romantically involved—no time for that in the apocalypse, and it would distract from the comedy
- Raccoon becomes the emotional core by Act 3; his safety matters more than theirs

**Scenes That Need Special Attention:**
- **Opening sequence** must establish tone immediately—this is comedy, not grim apocalypse drama
- **Each settlement encounter** needs a distinct comedic rhythm (slapstick, deadpan, absurdist, etc.)
- **The bunker descent** shifts tone slightly—still funny but with rising dread
- **The explosion aftermath** is the emotional beat—silence, then the raccoon's judgment
- **The ending** must stick the landing: no growth, no lessons, ready to fail again

**Worldbuilding Details:**
- What caused the war? (Doesn't matter—never explained, nobody remembers correctly anyway)
- How do settlements survive? (Subsistence farming, scavenging, barter economy)
- Are there larger power structures? (No—everywhere is small isolated groups)
- What's the raccoon's origin? (Unknown—he's just smart, like some mutations do that)

**Research Needed:**
- Nuclear weapon safety protocols (for accurate parody in cult scene)
- Radiation sickness symptoms (to show cultists are clearly dying but in denial)
- Post-apocalyptic survival comedy comp titles for market positioning
- Southwest filming locations with apocalyptic visuals

**Questions to Resolve:**
- Do we give the main characters names or keep them archetypal? (Names humanize, archetypes keep it broad)
- What's in the settlement that makes them desperate enough to risk this journey? (Food shortage? Tech failure? Boredom?)
- Does the raccoon have a name or just "the raccoon"? (Probably just "the raccoon" until Girl names him in Act 2)
- Mid-credit scene: Do we show another group finding a different signal, implying the cycle continues?
- Sequel potential: Is this a one-off or franchise starter? (Designed as standalone but open to more "idiot quest" adventures)

**Budget Considerations:**
Target $8-12M range:
- Practical creature effects over CG (cheaper, funnier)
- Southwest location shooting (tax incentives, cheap, authentic)
- Unknown or comedy character actors instead of stars
- ONE big VFX set piece (the explosion)
- Limit number of settlements to 4-5 detailed locations instead of many shallow ones

**Comps for Pitching:**
- *Zombieland* ($23M) - tone and road trip structure
- *Burn After Reading* ($37M) - dark comedy, idiots causing disasters
- *Hunt for the Wilderpeople* ($2.5M) - journey comedy with heart
- *What We Do in the Shadows* ($1.6M) - deadpan mockumentary style applied to genre
- Market position: R-rated dark comedy, post-apocalyptic setting WITHOUT being action film
