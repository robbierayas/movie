## CUBE MECHANICS REFERENCE

### Dimensional Terminology

The screenplay uses mathematical notation (n=X) for formal/technical contexts, but characters use colloquial terms in dialogue after Act 1, Scene 7 (when Marcus explains the concept to Edgar).

**Formal → Colloquial:**
- **n=0** → "singularity" (for a single cube shrunk to n=0) or "0-space" (for the space it exists in)
- **n=0.333** → "root-space" (referencing cube root)
- **n=1** → "1D"
- **n=2** → "2D"
- **n=3** → "3-space" or "3D"
- **n=4** → "hypercube" or "hyperspace"

**Usage in scenes:**
- Act 1, Scene 7: Edgar is confused and asks what the dimensional notation means; Marcus explains
- After Scene 7: Use colloquial terms in dialogue and informal narration
- Scene descriptions, technical explanations, and formal contexts can still use mathematical notation

### N=3 Cube Configuration
- 3×3×3 = 27 total cube rooms
- Each room has 6 equal-sized faces (floor, ceiling, 4 walls)
- Center of each face has a door to the next room
- 4 sets of ladder rungs per door, positioned 90° apart

### Visual Design
- Fractal-like tiles on blank wall spaces
- Tiles can change color when story requires it
- Walls do NOT shimmer or move (except when deploying traps)
- Walls emit light at normal brightness

### Door Mechanics
- Small square door located directly in the center of each cube face (not along the floor)
- Just big enough for a person with a backpack to crawl through
- No handle - doors open and close mechanically
- Doors can close and trap people
- When doors close, the cube mechanically rearranges entire rooms
- Rearrangement is physical, not dimensional
- Creates extreme disorientation through sameness and mechanical shuffling
- 4 sets of ladder rungs positioned 90° apart around each door for climbing

### Important Note
There are no actual dimensional effects in the n=3 rooms themselves - just mechanical rearrangement of identical spaces. The team perceives impossible geometry but it's actually confusion from sameness.

## ROOT CUBE SPECIFIC MECHANICS REFERENCE

### The Danger Zone Problem
The root-space cube contains areas of varying danger, with highly concentrated danger zones at multiple center points. Movement through these danger zones is NOT based on xyz spatial dimensions - you can't avoid danger by moving "left" or "right" in normal space. Instead, danger is based on dimensional saturation gradients that don't align with physical direction.

### How It Works (Pseudo-Science)
**Dimensional Saturation Gradient:**
- Dimensional saturation follows a gradient pattern in root-space
- Higher concentration near danger zone cores, dissipating toward boundaries
- At least three documented center points, possibly more
- Each center generates its own overlapping field

**Field Intersection and Interference:**
- When fields from multiple centers intersect, they don't cancel - they compound
- Rooms at intersection points experience constructive interference
- This creates zones of extreme instability and danger
- The danger is dimensional, not spatial

**Non-Spatial Navigation:**
- You cannot navigate away from danger using xyz movement alone
- Moving through a door may bring you closer to or further from a danger center
- The relationship between physical direction and dimensional saturation is not intuitive
- Random door selection = random movement through the danger gradient
- **This is specific to this film's cube mechanics**

**Transitional Zones:**
- Between n-values exist discrete dimensional layers (like geological strata)
- These transitional zones can be navigated if you understand the mechanics
- Barry and Josh achieved ~60% success rate navigating dimensionally
- The other 40% led to extreme danger (why Barry didn't survive)

### Navigation Methods (Discovered by Barry and Josh)
**Observable Markers:**
- Temperature gradients (protection field pulls heat from surrounding dimensional space)
- Electromagnetic field strength variations
- Visual distortion at thresholds between zones
- Acoustic resonance patterns (different echo patterns indicate proximity to landmarks)

**Dimensional Resonance Detection:**
- Barry built a jerryrigged detector from spectrometer parts
- Can measure dimensional saturation levels across zones
- Allows mapping of safe routes vs. high-danger intersection points
- Requires stable baseline (like lab building's protection field) for accurate readings

**Success Rate:**
- With proper understanding and equipment: ~60% navigation accuracy
- Without understanding: random/unpredictable movement through danger zones
- Better equipment and mapping could improve success rate significantly

### Writing Notes (Scene 23)
- Josh and Lea discuss these mechanics in detail during their scientific discussion
- Josh shares Barry's research and observations from three weeks of survival
- The lab building becomes strategically important as it provides:
    - Equipment for dimensional resonance detection
    - Stable baseline reference point for measurements
    - Protection field that marks a known safe location
- Josh's lucidity in Act 3 makes him the expert on dimensional navigation
- Temperature drop toward lab building is a concrete navigation marker
- 8-12 room transitions estimated to return to lab building using these methods

## MEMORY ERASURE MECHANICS

### The Problem
When people transition from n=0.333 BACK to n=3 space, their memories are erased. This is a major obstacle to escape.

### How It Works (Pseudo-Science)
- The transition from n=3 to n=0.333 has NO memory effect
- Memory erasure occurs during the RETURN from n=0.333 to n=3
- When returning to three-space, the dimensional vibration shift erases memories
- The vibrational energy damps (decreases) during the transition back to n=3
- As the vibration damps, the memory information encoded in it is lost
- This is why previous cube victims (referenced in earlier Cube films) woke up with no memory of how they got there

### The Solution (Discovered in Act 3, Scene 21)
- Morris proposes replicating the lab building's protective field as a "mind shield" on memories
- Nina corrects: this would only slow the dampening, not fully solve the problem
- Yuki realizes: an electron barrier can shield neural patterns during the transition
- The electron shield protects memory information during the vibration shift
- If the vibration dissipates slowly enough in 3D space, it can be directly absorbed (subatomic level)
- Nina and Yuki design small personal devices to create this electron shield
- The shield energy must dissipate properly in three-space after transition
- Concept inspired by the protective field around the lab building that maintains stability in root-space
- **Important**: The theoretical breakthrough happens ON-SCREEN in Scene 21, practical application happens OFF-SCREEN
- Josh's final wink implies the devices may not even be necessary (ambiguous ending note)

### Writing Notes
- Scene 21 establishes the theoretical foundation through Morris/Nina/Yuki discussion
- Keep technical details vague but consistent with Scene 21's established mechanics
- Morris contributes initial "mind shield" thought experiment (Act 3, Scene 21)
- Nina corrects and refines the concept (vibrational dampening)
- Yuki makes the breakthrough (electron barrier shields neural patterns)
- Between scenes, Nina and Yuki work out mathematics and build the devices
- Avoid overly technical explanations beyond what's in Scene 21

## DIMENSIONAL NAVIGATION MECHANICS

### Barry's Cryptic Message
Before losing contact, Barry sent fragmentary messages to the team. One phrase stood out: **"re-aligning the harmonic to the dimensional orbital."** Lea and her team researched this cryptic message and developed a theoretical understanding. Josh later provided Barry's notebook with practical data.

### Generic Theory (What Lea Explains - Scene 23)

**Dimensional Harmonics:**
- Every dimensional space (n=0, n=0.333, n=3, etc.) vibrates at a natural harmonic frequency
- Objects and people naturally resonate at the harmonic of their origin dimension
- This is related to the dimensional vibrations that cause memory erasure (see MEMORY ERASURE MECHANICS)
- When you enter a different dimensional space, your matter begins resonating with that new harmonic
- The resonance shift is what allows you to exist in the alternate dimension

**Dimensional Orbitals:**
- A "dimensional orbital" is a stable region or shell at a specific distance from a dimensional nucleus
- Like electron orbitals in atomic physics, dimensional orbitals are shells based on distance, not trajectory paths
- Each n-value space has multiple orbital shells at different distances from the nucleus
- Being within a stable orbital shell = safe navigation
- Being between orbital shells or at incorrect distances = random/dangerous movement

**Re-Alignment Principle:**
- To navigate safely between dimensions, you must "re-align" your harmonic to match the target orbital shell
- If your harmonic is aligned with a stable orbital shell, you remain within that safe region
- If misaligned, you drift randomly through dimensional space encountering hazards
- The key is detecting which orbital shell you're currently in and which door leads to the desired orbital shell
- This is different from the xyz spatial movement - you're navigating dimensional topology, not physical geography

**Why This Matters:**
- In n=3 space, movement is intuitive (left/right/up/down corresponds to physical location)
- In n=0.333 space, physical direction doesn't correspond to dimensional position
- You must navigate by orbital shells (distance from nuclei), not spatial direction
- Without understanding orbitals, all movement is effectively random

### Root-Space Specific Application (What Josh Explains from Barry's Notebook - Scene 23)

**Three Nuclei in Root-Space:**
- Orbitals form shells at distances from a nucleus - but root-space has THREE nuclei
- Each nucleus generates its own set of orbital shells
- The orbital shells from these three nuclei overlap in certain locations
- Where orbital shells overlap = ideal zones for safe re-alignment
- Finding orbital shell overlap zones is key to better navigation

**Barry's Device (The Quantameter):**
- Barry built a dimensional resonance detector from a quantameter
- Measures the room's distance to the nearest danger zone
- Uses this measurement to determine if the room is within a safe orbital shell
- Rooms far from danger zones = along stable orbital shells
- Rooms close to danger zones = near the nucleus
- Device was destroyed when Barry died

**The Lab Building Discovery:**
- Josh realizes the lab building was built where the orbital shells overlap
- This is why it's stable and safe
- The protection field maintains that stability
- The lab's location at orbital shell overlap makes it an ideal place for re-alignment

**Barry's Death:**
- Josh was there when Barry died
- Barry's device (the quantameter) was destroyed
- Josh managed to get Barry's notebook with all the research and data
- Alex asks if Barry gave him the notebook - Josh admits the circumstances

### Connection to Other Mechanics
- The dimensional vibrations that cause memory erasure (MEMORY ERASURE MECHANICS) are the same harmonics used for navigation
- The danger zones in ROOT CUBE SPECIFIC MECHANICS are areas outside safe orbital shells
- Safe rooms exist along stable orbital shells and especially at orbital shell overlap zones
- The lab building's protection field maintains stability at an orbital shell overlap location

### Writing Notes (Scene 23)
- Lea explains the generic theory based on research from Barry's cryptic message
- This is what they figured out in the lab before entering the cube
- Josh reveals Barry's notebook which contains the root-space specific practical data
- Josh didn't share it before because he "didn't think it would help" until Lea explained the theory
- After hearing Lea's explanation, Josh realizes Barry's data matches her theory perfectly
- Josh explains: three nuclei in root-space, orbital shells overlap, Barry's quantameter measured distance to danger zones
- Josh realizes the lab building is at an orbital shell overlap zone (why it's stable)
- Alex asks if Barry gave him the notebook - Josh admits he was there when Barry died, device destroyed but got the notebook
- Combining theory + practical data = ability to navigate root-space
- Keep dialogue focused on the key concepts without over-explaining the math

## WORKING WITH THIS PROJECT

1. **For plot/scene questions**: Check main.txt first
2. **For character dialogue/behavior**: Reference the appropriate file in Characters/
3. **For story outline**: Use table_of_contents.txt for quick navigation
4. **For trap ideas**: Check Trap Ideas.txt

Always maintain consistency with established character voices, plot points, and cube mechanics as defined in these source files.

---

## SCENE LAYOUT FORMATTING NOTE

In scene layout sections, quoted text attributed to characters represents their **thoughts or internal reactions**, not necessarily spoken dialogue. For example:
- Morris: "Did we just get bigger?" - This is Morris's thought/confusion
- Alex: "He knows this place" - This is Alex's internal assessment

The actual screenplay dialogue may differ from these thought representations.

4. **Create all 30 scene files** following this template
5. **Report completion**: List all created files organized by Act

### Workflow 3: When Scene Layout is Approved

When the user indicates the scene layout is approved (e.g., "the scene layout is how I want it", "scene layout looks good", "write the screenplay for this scene"), follow these steps for that scene:

1. **Remove the screenplay section** from the scene file
2. **Examine the character files** for all characters appearing in the scene
3. **Examine the scene layout and other sections** (Description, Key Elements, Character Moments, Establishes, etc.)
4. **Create the screenplay section** based on the scene layout
   - Maximum 300 lines
   - Reference character files for voice consistency
   - Translate scene layout thoughts into appropriate dialogue or action
5. **Update character files** with short descriptions in **"KEY SCENES"** section:
   - Add concise description of what happened in the scene for each character
   - Include key dialogue quotes, decisions made, and emotional beats
   - Keep descriptions SHORT (1-3 sentences focusing on actions and key quotes)
   - Format: "Act X, Scene Y: Scene Title - brief description with key moments and quotes"

### Workflow 4: When Scene Screenplay is Approved

When the user indicates the scene screenplay is approved (e.g., "the screenplay is how I want it", "screenplay looks good", "finalize this scene"), follow these steps for that scene:

1. **Reformat the screenplay** for consistency and clarity
2. **Update the scene description** in the file to match any screenplay changes
3. **Update character files** for all characters with significant moments in the scene:
   - Update **"KEY SCENES"** section with what happened in the screenplay
   - Update **"DIALOGUE STYLE"** section to capture how the character's voice manifested
   - DIALOGUE STYLE additions should:
     - Point out how the character's voice is different or unique
     - Give insight into deeper feelings revealed through dialogue
     - Only ADD to DIALOGUE STYLE, never remove existing content
     - User will edit/refine after

**Important**: These workflows ensure scene files, character files, and screenplay all stay synchronized as the project develops.

### Workflow 5: Character Profile Updates from Screenplay

When character profiles need updating to reflect completed screenplay, use this workflow to ensure consistency and flag any issues:

**Phase 1: Analysis & Inconsistency Detection**

For each character:

1. **Read KEY SCENES chronologically** (already complete and accurate from Workflow 2)
2. **Read DIALOGUE STYLE** (already complete and accurate from Workflow 2)
3. **Analyze patterns** and draft updates for:
   - **ARCHETYPE** (new section - Ensemble Role, see reference below)
   - **CHARACTER FUNCTION**
   - **PERSONALITY TRAITS**
   - **RELATIONSHIPS**
   - **CHARACTER ARC**

4. **Flag inconsistencies** before making changes:
   - Contradiction between current profile and screenplay evidence
   - Contradiction between KEY SCENES and DIALOGUE STYLE
   - Missing information in current profile
   - Outdated information that conflicts with finalized scenes
   - Character behavior that doesn't fit proposed archetype
   - Any conflicting characterization patterns

5. **Present report**: Show proposed changes + all flagged inconsistencies for each character
6. **Wait for user approval** before updating files

**Phase 2: Updates** (only after approval)

7. **Review DIALOGUE STYLE section** for quality improvements:
   - Check for duplicate descriptions (concepts that repeat even with different wording)
   - Remove quoted dialogue examples that don't enhance the description, but keep the analytical description itself
   - Flag any duplicates or unnecessary quotes found

8. Update character profiles with approved changes
9. Note: PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION and BASIC INFORMATION require manual script review (age, status, family, etc.) - separate task

**Inference Guidelines:**

- **CHARACTER FUNCTION**: Ask "What would this story lose if this character didn't exist?" Look for plot function (causes/reacts/witnesses), thematic function (what idea they embody), structural function (when they enter/exit, what changes), contrast function (who they're a foil to), emotional function (comic relief, horror, pathos, hope)

- **PERSONALITY TRAITS**: Cross-reference DIALOGUE STYLE (how they process info, handle stress, their values, social comfort) with KEY SCENES (consistent behaviors, reactions to stimuli, actions vs. words, growth/regression). If DIALOGUE STYLE shows rambling but KEY SCENES shows silence in crisis, that's meaningful characterization.

- **RELATIONSHIPS**: Track interaction frequency, quality (supportive/antagonistic), dialogue shifts with certain people, loyalty tests (who they defend/abandon), influence (who changes whose mind), death reactions (whose deaths affect them most). Note power dynamics.

- **CHARACTER ARC**: Structure from KEY SCENES - Beginning State (Act 1 beliefs/fears/goals), Inciting Incident (what challenges worldview), Escalation (Act 2 responses to pressure), Crisis Point (lowest moment/biggest choice), End State (how they changed or failed to change). Types: Positive Change (overcomes flaw), Negative Change (succumbs to flaw), Flat Arc (belief tested but holds), Disillusionment Arc (loses faith).

**Ensemble Role Archetypes Reference:**

Characters typically have a primary archetype with possible secondary traits. Archetypes can shift between Acts.

- **The Leader** - Takes charge, makes decisions, rallies others (often protagonist)
- **The Skeptic** - Questions everything, doubts plans, voice of caution
- **The Heart** - Emotional center, empathy, represents humanity/morality
- **The Brain** - Intellectual, solves problems through knowledge
- **The Comic Relief** - Breaks tension, provides levity (often while being competent)
- **The Pragmatist** - Practical solutions, grounded, "what works"
- **The Idealist** - Believes in principles, hope, doing the right thing
- **The Loyalist** - Devoted to person/cause, follows rather than leads
- **The Survivor** - Adapts, endures, prioritizes self-preservation
- **The Innocent** - Naive, trusting, represents purity/corruption
- **The Mentor** - Guides others, shares knowledge, often dies
- **The Wildcard** - Unpredictable, changes allegiances, keeps audience guessing
- **The Betrayer** - Turns on group, self-interested (can overlap with Skeptic/Survivor)
- **The Protector** - Shields others, sacrifices for the group
- **The Voice of Reason** - Cuts through emotion with logic and clarity
