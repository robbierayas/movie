# SCREENPLAY FORMATTING GUIDE

This section covers professional screenplay formatting standards for creating camera-ready scripts that can be directly translated into animation.

## Core Formatting Principles

**Professional screenplay format uses three main elements:**

1. **Action Lines**: Describe what the camera sees and character movements
2. **Dialogue**: What characters say, with the character name above
3. **Parentheticals (Wrylies)**: Brief notes about how dialogue is delivered (use sparingly)

## When to Use Parentheticals vs Action Lines

### Parentheticals (Wrylies)

**Use parentheticals ONLY for:**

- **Essential line delivery**: How the actor should say the line
  - `(whispered)`, `(shouting)`, `(quietly)`, `(singing)`, `(through gritted teeth)`
- **Brief physical actions during dialogue**: Very short actions that happen while speaking
  - `(cutting in)`, `(to Marcus)`, `(standing)`, `(turning away)`
- **Timing beats**: Pauses in dialogue
  - `(beat)`, `(long pause)`

**Parenthetical Rules:**
- Keep them SHORT - fragments only, never full sentences
- Use lowercase (unless proper name)
- One or two words maximum
- Never end a dialogue block with a parenthetical
- Don't overuse - if on every page, you're using too many

**Examples:**

```
                    LEA
               (whispered)
          We need to get out of here.

                    ALEX
               (cutting in)
          No. We stay together.

                    MARCUS
          If we leave now...
               (beat)
          We might never find Josh.
```

### Action Lines

**Use action lines for:**

- **Character movements and blocking**: Where characters move, what they do
- **Emotional reactions**: Facial expressions, body language
- **Environmental details**: What the camera sees
- **Complex actions**: Anything requiring more than 2-3 words
- **Scene atmosphere**: Mood, lighting, sound

**Action Line Rules:**
- Written in present tense
- Show what the camera sees, not what characters think/feel internally
- Be specific and visual
- Break into short paragraphs for readability
- Use active voice

**Examples:**

```
EDGAR stands at the whiteboard, tie loosened, sleeves rolled up to his elbows. The marker squeaks as he tallies numbers with corporate precision.

By the windows, ALEX and LEA stand shoulder to shoulder, faces reflected in the glass. Alex's arms are crossed tight.

Morris's leg bounces with nervous energy. Darius watches the group but doesn't join it.
```

## Camera Direction in Screenplays

**Modern spec screenplays avoid technical camera directions.** Instead, imply camera movement through action description.

### ❌ Avoid Technical Directions:
- `CLOSE UP ON Edgar's hand`
- `CAMERA PANS TO the window`
- `CRANE SHOT revealing the room`
- `ANGLE ON Alex`
- `POV SHOT from Lea's perspective`

### ✅ Use Visual Action Description:

Instead of technical terms, describe what the camera sees in a way that implies the shot:

**For close-ups:**
```
Edgar's hand trembles as he caps the marker. Sweat beads on his forehead.
```

**For panning/reveals:**
```
The rest of the team scattered around the lab like survivors of a shipwreck:

MORRIS slumps in an office chair, one leg bouncing with nervous energy.

DARIUS leans against the far wall, arms crossed, face unreadable.
```

**For establishing shots:**
```
INT. QL BUILDING - LAB - DAWN

Harsh fluorescent lights hum overhead. Empty coffee cups litter the work tables. Equipment blinks and beeps, indifferent to the exhaustion.

Through the lab windows: impossible geometry. Cube walls where the parking lot should be.
```

**For point-of-view:**
```
Lea presses her hand against the window, staring out at the cube structure beyond. Her reflection stares back, dark circles under her eyes.
```

## Dialogue Formatting

### Basic Dialogue Format

```
                    CHARACTER NAME
          The dialogue goes here. Keep it
          concise and natural.
```

### Dialogue with Parenthetical

```
                    CHARACTER NAME
               (quietly)
          The dialogue goes here.
```

### Continued Dialogue (Interrupted by Action)

```
                    CHARACTER NAME
          We need to explore. Josh is out there.
          Barry too. We can't just sit here and—

                    YUKI
               (cutting in)
          We could stay. Board up the doors.
```

### Dialogue Across Scene Break

```
                    EDGAR
          Then it's up to us.
                    (MORE)

                                                        CUT TO:

INT. QL BUILDING - LOBBY - LATER

                    EDGAR (CONT'D)
          Equipment distributed? Everyone
          have what they need?
```

## Show Don't Tell: Converting Telling to Showing

### ❌ Telling (Stage Direction Style):

```
EDGAR is worried but trying to stay calm. He addresses the team nervously.

                    EDGAR
               (nervous but calm)
          Alright. Inventory time.

Lea is passionate and upset.

                    LEA
               (passionate, upset)
          We need to explore!
```

### ✅ Showing (Visual Screenplay Style):

```
Edgar caps the marker. His jaw tightens. He turns to face the room.

                    EDGAR
          Alright.

Heads turn toward him. Morris's leg stops bouncing.

                    EDGAR (CONT'D)
          Inventory time.

Lea turns from the window, jaw set.

                    LEA
          We need to explore. Josh is out there.
          Barry too. We can't just sit here and—
```

## Blocking and Character Movement

**Integrate character movement into action lines, not parentheticals:**

### ❌ Bad:
```
                    ALEX
               (turns from window, steps to center, arms crossed)
          No one's coming.
```

### ✅ Good:
```
Alex turns from the window. Her voice cuts through the hope.

                    ALEX
          No one's coming.

She steps to the center of the room, arms crossed.
```

## Character Introductions

**IMPORTANT:** Character age/description appears ONLY on first appearance in the entire screenplay.

### First Appearance (First Scene Only)

When a character appears for the FIRST time in the screenplay, introduce them with:
- **Name in ALL CAPS**
- Age/description in parentheses immediately after name
- Visual description in the action line

```
INT. QL BUILDING - FOOD RESEARCH LAB - DAY

ALEX (30s, practical, focused) walks through the pristine lobby carrying a coffee, wearing backpack and noise-cancelling headphones.

MORRIS (40s, disheveled, perpetually sniffly) hunches over a workstation, adjusting goggles that keep sliding down his nose.
```

### All Subsequent Appearances

After the first introduction, use **only the character name in proper case** (not ALL CAPS, no age/description):

```
INT. QL BUILDING - LOBBY - LATER

Alex leans against the wall, voice recorder in hand.

Morris hunches over the measurement device, goggles sliding down his nose again.
```

### Common Mistakes

❌ **Wrong - Including age every scene:**
```
Scene 1:
ALEX (30s, practical, focused) walks through the lobby.

Scene 5:
ALEX (30s, practical, focused) leans against the wall.  ← WRONG!
```

✅ **Correct - Age only on first appearance:**
```
Scene 1:
ALEX (30s, practical, focused) walks through the lobby.

Scene 5:
Alex leans against the wall.  ← CORRECT!
```

### Character Name Format Summary

| Context | Format | Example |
|---------|--------|---------|
| **First appearance in script** | ALL CAPS + (age, traits) | `ALEX (30s, practical, focused)` |
| **Action lines (after intro)** | Proper case, no description | `Alex leans against the wall.` |
| **Dialogue header** | ALL CAPS, no description | `ALEX` |
| **Dialogue header (continued)** | ALL CAPS + (CONT'D) | `ALEX (CONT'D)` |

## Montages and Series of Shots

Montages are a powerful storytelling tool for compressing time, showing transformation, or connecting thematic ideas visually. Understanding when and how to use montages is essential for modern screenplay writing.

### What is a Montage?

**Montage:** A series of brief shots that condense time, show progress, or connect thematic ideas. Montages can span minutes, hours, days, weeks, or even years of story time in just a few seconds of screen time.

**Key characteristics:**
- Compresses time significantly
- Often shows transformation or progress
- Can be scored to music
- Minimal or no dialogue
- Each shot is a brief visual moment, not a full scene

### Types of Montages

#### Linear Montage (Progress/Transformation)
Shows chronological progress over time. Each shot builds on the last.

**Common uses:**
- Training montage (character learning a skill)
- Relationship development (couple falling in love)
- Construction/preparation (building something over time)
- Journey montage (traveling across distance)
- Deterioration (character's decline)

**Example from Anno Bombini:** The journey home after the explosion, showing them traveling back across locations they visited.

#### Thematic Montage (Conceptual/Mood)
A collection of shots connected by a central idea, mood, or topic rather than chronology.

**Common uses:**
- Different characters reacting to the same event
- Showing patterns of behavior across society
- Contrasting lifestyles or situations
- Establishing atmosphere of a location/world
- Commentary on theme

**Example from Anno Bombini:** Opening montage showing different settlements' absurd approaches to post-apocalyptic survival.

#### Series of Shots
Quick succession of shots that play out over a short time frame, more narrative than transformational.

**Difference from montage:**
- SERIES OF SHOTS: Short time frame (minutes/hours), straightforward chronology
- MONTAGE: Longer time frame (days/weeks/months), shows transformation or thematic connection

**Common uses:**
- Quick action sequence
- Rapid investigation
- Characters preparing for immediate event
- Multiple simultaneous events happening quickly

**Example:** Team packing supplies and preparing to leave (happens in minutes, not hours).

#### Intercut
Shows two or more scenes happening simultaneously by cutting back and forth.

**Common uses:**
- Phone conversations (both sides)
- Parallel action (different groups doing different things)
- Contrast (hero and villain preparing)
- Cross-cutting for tension

**Note:** Intercuts are formatted differently than montages (covered below).

### Three Methods to Format Montages

**Important:** Pick ONE method per script and stay consistent. All three are acceptable; clarity is what matters.

#### Method 1: MONTAGE Header (Most Common)

Best for: Single-location montages or when you want clear bookends.

```
BEGIN MONTAGE - TRAINING

- Alex practices climbing cube walls, falls repeatedly.

- Alex makes it halfway up, slips, catches herself.

- Alex reaches the top, pumps her fist in victory.

- Alex descends smoothly, confident now.

END MONTAGE
```

**Variations:**
- `MONTAGE - [DESCRIPTION]` / `END MONTAGE`
- `BEGIN MONTAGE` / `END MONTAGE`
- `CUE MONTAGE` / `END MONTAGE`

**Key formatting:**
- Simple dash list or numbered list
- One line per shot (brief, visual)
- No need for full scene headings
- Bookend clearly with BEGIN/END

#### Method 2: Scene Heading with Brief Slug Lines

Best for: Multi-location montages where location matters.

```
MONTAGE - THE JOURNEY HOME

WASTELAND - DAY
They walk in silence, mushroom cloud still visible behind them.

DRIED RIVERBED - DUSK
Guy 1 tries to spin the story. Girl ignores him.

ABANDONED HIGHWAY - NIGHT
They make camp. Raccoon sits apart, judging.

SETTLEMENT OUTSKIRTS - DAWN
They approach home. Guy 2 rehearses their explanation.

END MONTAGE
```

**Key formatting:**
- Start with MONTAGE scene heading
- Brief location slugs (not full INT./EXT. headings)
- One-line descriptions per location
- End with END MONTAGE

#### Method 3: Series of Short Scenes

Best for: When each moment needs more detail or when you want to avoid "montage" label.

```
EXT. WASTELAND - DAY

They walk in silence. The mushroom cloud still visible on the horizon behind them.

EXT. DRIED RIVERBED - DUSK

Guy 1 tries to explain how it's not really their fault. Girl doesn't respond, just keeps walking.

EXT. ABANDONED HIGHWAY - NIGHT

They make camp around a small fire. Raccoon sits ten feet away, staring at them with judgment in his eyes.

EXT. SETTLEMENT OUTSKIRTS - DAWN

They crest the hill. Home visible below. Guy 2 nervously rehearses their explanation under his breath.
```

**Key formatting:**
- Full scene headings
- Slightly more description than Method 1 or 2
- Reader will recognize it's a montage by brevity and pacing
- No need to label as "montage"

**When to use Method 3:**
- Each location needs slightly more detail
- You want to avoid the word "MONTAGE"
- The pacing is important to reading experience
- Each moment has a small character beat

### Formatting SERIES OF SHOTS

```
SERIES OF SHOTS - PACKING TO LEAVE

A) Morris and Chen divide measurement equipment into backpacks.

B) Yuki loads compressed food rations, counting carefully.

C) Edgar distributes water bottles, checking levels.

D) Alex organizes weapons and tools by the door.

END SERIES OF SHOTS
```

**Key differences from montage:**
- Labeled SERIES OF SHOTS (not MONTAGE)
- Typically uses letter labels (A, B, C) or dashes
- Happens quickly (minutes, not hours/days)
- More functional than transformational

### Formatting INTERCUTS

**Method 1: INTERCUT Header**

```
INTERCUT - PHONE CONVERSATION

INT. HOME SETTLEMENT - RADIO ROOM - DAY

Guy 1 holds the radio transmitter.

                    GUY 1
          We found it. The power source.

INT. DISTANT SETTLEMENT - RADIO ROOM - DAY

Leader leans forward, excited.

                    LEADER
          Bring it back! How soon can—

                    GUY 1 (V.O.)
          There's been a complication.

Back to Guy 1, sweating.

                    GUY 1
          It's not exactly... portable.

END INTERCUT
```

**Method 2: Brief Location Slugs**

```
INT. HOME SETTLEMENT - RADIO ROOM - DAY

Guy 1 holds the radio transmitter.

                    GUY 1
          We found it. The power source.

INTERCUT WITH:

INT. DISTANT SETTLEMENT - RADIO ROOM

Leader leans forward, excited.

                    LEADER
          Bring it back! How soon can—

                    GUY 1 (V.O.)
          There's been a complication.
```

### When to Use Montages

**✅ Use montages when:**
- You need to compress significant time (days, weeks, months)
- Showing progress/training/transformation
- Establishing the passage of time
- Creating emotional/thematic connection between disparate moments
- Showing multiple reactions to same event
- Journey across distance

**❌ Don't use montages when:**
- The action happens in real time (use regular scenes)
- Each moment needs dialogue and character interaction
- The progression isn't clear without more detail
- You're using it to skip writing difficult scenes
- Each moment is a full scene that matters to plot

**Ask yourself:**
- Does this condense time significantly? (Montage)
- Or does this happen in a few minutes? (Series of Shots or regular scenes)
- Does each moment need dialogue/interaction? (Probably not a montage)

### Montage Writing Best Practices

#### Keep Individual Shots Brief
Each line should be ONE visual moment, not a paragraph.

**❌ Too much detail:**
```
- Alex approaches the wall, takes a deep breath, reaches up to grab the first handhold, pulls herself up slowly with great effort, her muscles straining as she tries to find the next grip
```

**✅ Brief and visual:**
```
- Alex climbs the wall, muscles straining, barely makes it halfway.
```

#### Make Each Shot Build or Connect
**Linear montage:** Each shot should show progression.
```
- Guy 1 confidently declares his plan.
- Guy 1's plan immediately fails.
- Guy 2 tries his own plan, equally confident.
- Guy 2's plan also fails.
- Girl executes the obvious solution that works.
```

**Thematic montage:** Each shot should relate to the theme.
```
MONTAGE - SETTLEMENTS REACT TO THE EXPLOSION

- Preppers see mushroom cloud, nod knowingly: "Told you so."
- Hermit adds it to conspiracy wall with red string.
- Cargo cult priests interpret it as divine sign.
- Home settlement debates whether to send rescue party.
```

#### Use Montages Sparingly
**General rule:** 1-3 montages per script maximum.

Too many montages = lazy writing or lack of real scenes.

#### Consider Music/Score
Montages are often scored. You can suggest this in the slug:

```
MONTAGE - THE JOURNEY HOME (MUSIC)
```

But don't specify the song unless it's critical to the story.

### Common Montage Mistakes

**❌ Mistake 1: Creating new scene headings for every shot**
```
BEGIN MONTAGE

INT. TRAINING ROOM - DAY
Alex climbs wall.

INT. TRAINING ROOM - DAY
Alex falls.

INT. TRAINING ROOM - DAY
Alex tries again.

END MONTAGE
```

**✅ Fix: Use simple list format**
```
MONTAGE - TRAINING

- Alex climbs the wall.
- Alex falls.
- Alex tries again, makes it higher.

END MONTAGE
```

**❌ Mistake 2: Using CUT TO: between montage shots**
```
MONTAGE

- Alex climbs.

CUT TO:

- Alex falls.

CUT TO:

- Alex tries again.
```

**✅ Fix: Cuts are implied, don't write them**
```
MONTAGE

- Alex climbs.
- Alex falls.
- Alex tries again.
```

**❌ Mistake 3: Writing dialogue-heavy montages**
Montages should be primarily visual.

**❌ Mistake 4: Making montages too long**
General rule: Montages should be 3-8 shots. More than 10 shots feels like you're avoiding writing real scenes.

**❌ Mistake 5: Unclear what's being shown**
```
MONTAGE - THINGS HAPPEN

- Stuff occurs.
- More events.
- Things continue.
```

**✅ Fix: Be specific and visual**
```
MONTAGE - SCAVENGING THE WASTELAND

- Guy 1 pries open a rusted vending machine. Empty.
- Girl finds a working flashlight in an abandoned car.
- Raccoon drags a bag of chips from a collapsed gas station.
- Guy 2 discovers a cache of batteries, checks them. All dead.
```

### Animation Considerations for Montages

When writing montages for animation projects:

**1. Specify Key Positions**
```
MONTAGE - ALEX CROSSES THE CUBE ROOM

- Alex at NORTH door, looking down into the room below.
- Alex climbs down the EAST wall using ladder rungs.
- Alex reaches the FLOOR, checks her device.
- Alex climbs toward the SOUTH door.
```

**2. Consider Camera Placement**
```
MONTAGE - THE TEAM PREPARES (VARIOUS ANGLES)

- WIDE: Team spreads across the lab, packing stations.
- CLOSE: Morris carefully wraps measurement devices.
- MEDIUM: Yuki and Chen divide food rations.
- WIDE: Edgar surveys the group, nods with determination.
```

**3. Note Lighting/Time Changes**
```
MONTAGE - DAYS IN THE CUBE

- DAY 1: Team enters fresh cube room, walls bright white.
- DAY 3: Same room, walls now pale blue, team exhausted.
- DAY 5: Walls deep purple, team barely moving.
- DAY 7: Walls black, emergency lights only.
```

**4. Specify Reusable Assets**
If using same locations/props across montage:
```
MONTAGE - EXPLORING N=3 ROOMS

[Note: All rooms identical cube structure, only wall colors differ]

- Room 1 (white walls): Team enters cautiously.
- Room 2 (red walls): Team more confident, moving faster.
- Room 3 (yellow walls): Team splits up to check doors.
- Room 4 (black walls): Team reunites, discusses route.
```

### Examples in Different Genres

#### Comedy Montage (Anno Bombini style)
```
MONTAGE - MAKING EVERYTHING WORSE

PREPPER COMPOUND
Guy 1 "helps" repair their defenses. Wall collapses.

HERMIT'S FORTRESS
Guy 2 accidentally triggers elaborate trap system.

CARGO CULT SETTLEMENT
Girl tries to fix their oracle. Sparks. Small fire.

RIVAL CAMP
All three attempt stealth. Immediately spotted.

END MONTAGE
```

#### Drama/Thriller Montage
```
MONTAGE - THE INVESTIGATION

- Detective pins photos to murder board, draws connections.
- Lab tech runs DNA samples, compares results.
- Detective interviews witness #1, takes notes.
- Security footage reviewed, timestamp noted.
- Detective interviews witness #2, realizes contradiction.
- Lab results print out. Detective's eyes widen.

END MONTAGE
```

#### Training Montage (Classic)
```
MONTAGE - BECOMING A FIGHTER

- Week 1: Chen struggles with basic stance, falls repeatedly.
- Week 2: Chen practices strikes, form improving.
- Week 3: Chen spars with instructor, lands first hit.
- Week 4: Chen runs obstacle course, leaps and rolls smoothly.
- Week 5: Chen faces three opponents, defeats them all.

END MONTAGE
```

### Quick Reference: Montage Checklist

Before writing a montage, check:

- [ ] Does this compress significant time? (If not, regular scenes)
- [ ] Is progression/connection clear between shots?
- [ ] Are individual shots brief and visual?
- [ ] Is this 3-8 shots total? (Not too long)
- [ ] Have I chosen consistent formatting method?
- [ ] Is dialogue minimal or absent?
- [ ] Does each shot show a distinct visual moment?
- [ ] Have I avoided technical camera directions?
- [ ] Is the purpose clear (training, journey, thematic, etc.)?
- [ ] Could this be better served as regular scenes? (If yes, don't montage)

---

## Scene Transitions

**Common transitions:**

- `FADE IN:` - Opening of script or act
- `FADE OUT:` - Closing of script or act
- `CUT TO:` - Quick transition (most common, often implied)
- `DISSOLVE TO:` - Slow transition showing time passage
- `SMASH CUT TO:` - Abrupt jarring transition
- `MATCH CUT TO:` - Visual element continues between scenes

**Modern practice:** Most scripts don't use transition lines between scenes. Simply start the new scene heading. Use transitions only when the type of cut matters to the story.

## Room Setup and Description

**First time in a location:** Describe it clearly in action lines under the scene heading.

```
INT. QL BUILDING - LAB - DAWN

Harsh fluorescent lights hum overhead. Empty coffee cups litter the work tables. Equipment blinks and beeps, indifferent to the exhaustion.

Through the lab windows: impossible geometry. Cube walls where the parking lot should be. The morning light filtering through them casts wrong-angled shadows across the floor.
```

**Subsequent visits:** Brief reminder or skip entirely if reader knows the location.

```
INT. QL BUILDING - LAB - LATER

The team has returned. Equipment still scattered across tables. The cube walls beyond the windows unchanged.
```

## Complete Example: Before and After

### Before (Over-Directed, Unclear):

```
INT. LAB - MORNING

Team sits around. Everyone tired.

EDGAR at whiteboard. Counting supplies.

                    EDGAR
               (efficient)
          Alright everyone. Sof-tak, 100. Water, 2 cases.

                    LEA
               (emotional)
          We need to find Josh!

Camera pans to YUKI.

                    YUKI
               (nervous)
          Maybe stay here?

FADE TO:

INT. LOBBY

Team now ready with bags.

                    ALEX
               (leader-like)
          Stay together everyone.
```

### After (Camera-Ready, Visual):

```
INT. QL BUILDING - LAB - DAWN

Harsh fluorescent lights hum overhead. Empty coffee cups litter the work tables.

EDGAR stands at the whiteboard, tie loosened, sleeves rolled up. The marker squeaks as he tallies numbers with corporate precision.

By the windows, ALEX and LEA stand shoulder to shoulder, faces reflected in the glass.

MORRIS slumps in an office chair, one leg bouncing with nervous energy. DARIUS leans against the far wall, arms crossed, face unreadable.

Edgar caps the marker. Turns to face the room.

                    EDGAR
          Alright. Inventory. Compressed
          sof-tak—one hundred units. Water—
          nearly two cases.

Lea turns from the window, jaw set.

                    LEA
          We need to explore. Josh is out there.
          Barry too. We can't just sit here and—

                    YUKI
               (cutting in)
          We could stay. Board up the doors.
          Make this place defensible.

Alex turns from the window. Her voice cuts through the hope.

                    ALEX
          No one's coming.

The room goes quiet.

CUT TO:

INT. QL BUILDING - LOBBY - LATER

The team spreads across the lobby in small groups. Backpacks at their feet, being loaded with supplies. The mood is tense, focused.

Morris and Chen crouch near the reception desk, dividing measurement equipment into equal loads.

Edgar moves between groups, checking supplies, asking quiet questions. His tie is gone now. He's transformed—no trace of the corporate VP.

Alex steps forward, looks at each face in turn.

                    ALEX
          Stay together. Stay alert.

She takes a breath.

                    ALEX (CONT'D)
          We find Josh. We find Barry.
          We find a way out.
```

## Animation-Ready Formatting Workflow

**Command:** "Make sure scene X is formatted for animation"

**Purpose:** Create a camera-ready copy of the screenplay that can be directly translated into Three.js animation code.

**Process:**

### STEP 1: Read the Scene
- Read the entire scene file
- Identify all action lines, dialogue, and parentheticals
- Note the structure: scene headings, transitions, character movements
- Separate script content from descriptions/notes

### STEP 2: Create Camera-Ready Copy
- Create a new file in the same folder with `cam_` prefix
  - Example: `Scene 1 - Survival and Rationing.txt` → `cam_Scene 1 - Survival and Rationing.txt`
- Copy ONLY the full script part (exclude descriptions, production notes, character descriptions)
- Include: Scene headings, action lines, dialogue, transitions
- Exclude: Background notes, character bios, location descriptions that aren't part of the script

### STEP 3: Check Parentheticals (Use Sparingly)
- Count parentheticals on each page
- **Target:** Fewer than 5 per page
- **Fix:** Convert unnecessary parentheticals to action lines
  - `(nervously)` → `Yuki's hands fidget with the device. Her voice small:`
  - `(angry)` → `Alex's jaw tightens. Her voice sharp:`
  - `(standing up and walking to door)` → Move to action line before dialogue

### STEP 4: Remove Technical Camera Directions
- Search for technical terms: "CLOSE UP", "CAMERA", "ANGLE", "PAN", "CRANE", "POV"
- **Fix:** Convert to visual description
  - `CLOSE UP ON Edgar's hand` → `Edgar's hand trembles as he caps the marker.`
  - `CAMERA PANS TO window` → `By the windows, Alex and Lea stand shoulder to shoulder.`
  - `ANGLE ON door` → `At the door, Marcus's hand hovers over the handle.`

### STEP 5: Show Don't Tell
- Find action lines that tell emotions instead of showing them
  - ❌ `Edgar is nervous but trying to stay calm`
  - ✅ `Edgar's jaw tightens. He takes a breath before turning to the team.`
- Find parentheticals describing emotions
  - ❌ `(worried but determined)`
  - ✅ Show through action before dialogue: `Lea's jaw sets. Her voice steady despite the fear in her eyes:`

### STEP 6: Check Action Lines Format
- [ ] Written in present tense
- [ ] Show what camera sees, not internal thoughts
- [ ] Specific and visual (not vague)
- [ ] Short paragraphs (3-4 lines max per paragraph)
- [ ] Active voice

**Examples:**
- ❌ `Edgar thinks about the situation while standing there worried`
- ✅ `Edgar's jaw tightens. He shifts his weight. His eyes dart to the window.`

### STEP 7: Verify Character Blocking
- Check that character movements are in action lines, not parentheticals
- Ensure movements are clear and specific
- **Fix:**
  - ❌ `(crosses room)` in parenthetical
  - ✅ `Alex crosses the room, arms crossed tight.` in action line before dialogue

### STEP 8: Check Scene Structure
- [ ] Scene heading clear: `INT./EXT. - LOCATION - TIME`
- [ ] Location described on first visit (what camera sees)
- [ ] Transitions only when type of cut matters (CUT TO, FADE OUT, etc.)
- [ ] White space used effectively (not walls of text)
- [ ] Character names CAPITALIZED on first appearance in scene

### STEP 9: Verify Dialogue Format
- [ ] Character name centered above dialogue
- [ ] Dialogue properly indented
- [ ] `(CONT'D)` used when same character continues after action line
- [ ] `(MORE)` and `(CONT'D)` used when dialogue spans scene break

### STEP 10: Ensure Animation Translation Clarity
- Can each action line be translated to specific Three.js code?
- Are character positions/movements clear enough for coordinate placement?
- Is blocking specific enough to choreograph?
  - ❌ `Team spreads out in room`
  - ✅ `Morris and Chen crouch near the reception desk. Nina, Rashid, and Yuki sit in a triangle on the floor near the elevator. Darius stands alone by the windows.`

### STEP 11: Final Verification Checklist
- [ ] Parentheticals: Fewer than 5 per page, only essential delivery/beats
- [ ] Camera directions: No technical terms, only visual description
- [ ] Action lines: Present tense, show not tell, camera-visible only
- [ ] Character emotions: Shown through behavior, not told
- [ ] Blocking: Specific positions and movements in action lines
- [ ] Dialogue: Properly formatted with character names
- [ ] Scene headings: Clear INT./EXT., location, and time
- [ ] White space: Used effectively for readability
- [ ] Animation-ready: Clear enough to translate to coordinates and actions

### STEP 12: Report Changes
- List all changes made
- Highlight any areas that still need clarification
- Confirm scene is animation-ready

**Expected Output:**
- Formatted scene file
- Summary of changes made
- Confirmation that scene can be translated to Three.js animation code

## TTS Production Requirements

**IMPORTANT:** For TTS audio generation, screenplays must follow strict formatting standards.

### Required Format for TTS:
- **Character names**: Centered with 20 spaces indentation in ALL CAPS
- **Dialogue**: Indented with 10 spaces, following character name
- **Action lines**: Full sentences describing what camera sees (NO parentheticals)
- **Blank lines**: Between dialogue blocks and action descriptions

### Example of TTS-Ready Format:
```
Alex moves toward the window.

                    ALEX
          We need to leave now.

Morris stands, his voice shaking.

                    MORRIS
          Are you sure about this?
```

### Formatting Script: `format_screenplay_dialogue.py`

If your screenplay has parentheticals like `(moving toward window)` or unindented dialogue, use the formatting script before generating TTS audio:

```bash
cd production/audio
python format_screenplay_dialogue.py "../../writing/acts/Act 1 - Explaining the New Cube/Scene X.txt"
```

This will automatically:
- Convert parentheticals to proper action lines
- Indent character names (20 spaces)
- Indent dialogue (10 spaces)
- **Convert ALL CAPS character names in action lines to proper case**
  - Example: `MARCUS turns, annoyed.` → `Marcus turns, annoyed.`
  - Character headers stay ALL CAPS: `                    MARCUS`
- Maintain proper spacing
- Wrap long lines to 121 characters (without chopping words)

**Important**: Character names in action lines should be proper case (not ALL CAPS):
- ✅ **Correct**: `Marcus turns, annoyed.` or `Josh, suddenly lucid, sharp.`
- ❌ **Incorrect**: `MARCUS turns, annoyed.` (will be treated as dialogue header by TTS)

**Note**: The TTS parser expects standard screenplay formatting. Improperly formatted files may result in all text being read as action/narrator instead of character dialogue.

**Before running TTS:** Always format your screenplay using `format_screenplay_dialogue.py` to ensure proper character voice assignment.

## Quick Reference

| Element | When to Use | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Parenthetical** | Essential delivery or brief action | `(whispered)`, `(beat)`, `(to Marcus)` |
| **Action Line** | Movements, emotions, scene details | `Edgar's hand trembles as he caps the marker.` |
| **Scene Description** | First time in location, what camera sees | `Empty coffee cups litter the work tables.` |
| **Dialogue** | What characters say | Standard format: name above, dialogue below |
