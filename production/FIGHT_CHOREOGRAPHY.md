## PURPOSE OF FIGHT SCENES

Fight scenes are not just action spectacles—they're narrative tools that must serve the story:

1. **Advance Plot**: The outcome changes the situation (someone escapes, someone dies, information is revealed)
2. **Reveal Character**: How someone fights tells us who they are (dirty fighter vs. honorable, skilled vs. desperate)
3. **Increase Tension**: Stakes escalate, injuries accumulate, the situation worsens
4. **Embody Theme**: The fight itself can represent the story's central conflict

**Key Principle**: The most memorable fight sequences are remembered for their drama, not their specific kicks and punches.

## WRITING FIGHT SCENES IN SCREENPLAY FORMAT

### The Balance Problem

Two extremes to avoid:
- **Too vague**: "They fight." (Gives no creative input, makes budgeting impossible)
- **Too detailed**: Move-by-move descriptions (Limits the stunt coordinator, bogs down the read)

### The Sweet Spot

Write the **story beats** of the fight, not the specific choreography:

```
BAD (too detailed):
John throws a right hook. Mike blocks with his left forearm,
counters with an uppercut. John sidesteps, grabs Mike's arm,
twists it behind his back...

BAD (too vague):
They fight. John wins.

GOOD (story beats):
John and Mike trade blows—evenly matched until Mike spots
the knife on the counter. He lunges for it. John tackles him
before he can reach it. They crash through the kitchen table.

Mike's hand closes on a table leg. He swings—connects with
John's ribs. John doubles over.

Mike scrambles for the knife again. Gets it. Turns.

John's already gone—out the back door.
```

### Formatting Tips

- **Short, punchy sentences** mimic the pace of combat
- **White space** on the page speeds up the read
- **Each beat gets its own line** for impact
- **Sound and impact** can be capitalized for emphasis: CRACK. THUD. CRASH.

## THE FOUR PRINCIPLES OF FIGHT CHOREOGRAPHY

### 1. Blocking
Where combatants are positioned relative to each other and the environment. The screenplay should establish:
- Starting positions
- Key position changes (cornered, separated, one gains high ground)
- Environmental anchors (the table between them, the doorway they're fighting toward)

### 2. Flow
How the fight moves through space and time. Consider:
- Does it stay contained or travel?
- What triggers momentum shifts?
- How does it escalate?

### 3. Variation
Prevents monotony. Mix:
- Close combat vs. distance
- Weapons vs. unarmed
- Standing vs. ground fighting
- Aggressive vs. defensive moments
- Fast exchanges vs. tense standoffs

### 4. Continuity
Injuries, exhaustion, and damage must persist:
- A hurt hand affects later punches
- A cut above the eye limits vision
- Exhaustion slows both fighters
- Broken furniture stays broken

## MULTI-ROOM FIGHTS

Extended fights that travel through multiple spaces require special attention.

### Principles

**1. Each Room = A New Chapter**
Each space should have its own mini-arc with:
- A new environmental challenge or advantage
- A shift in who has the upper hand
- Escalation of stakes or damage

**2. Transitions Are Story Beats**
How they move from room to room matters:
- Retreat (defensive, losing)
- Pursuit (offensive, winning)
- Mutual crash through wall/door (chaos, desperation)
- Tactical repositioning (strategic, calculating)

**3. Geography Must Be Clear**
The reader needs to track:
- Which room they're in
- How rooms connect
- Where escape routes and dangers are

### Structure Template

```
ROOM 1 - INITIAL ENGAGEMENT
- Establishes the combatants' skill levels
- First blood or advantage
- Trigger for transition (crash through door, one retreats)

ROOM 2 - ESCALATION
- New environmental elements come into play
- Power dynamic shifts
- Injuries accumulate
- Trigger for transition

ROOM 3 - CLIMAX
- Final confrontation
- Environment is maximally used or destroyed
- Decisive outcome
```

### Example: Kitchen → Living Room → Stairs

```
KITCHEN - They crash into the kitchen island. Knives rattle
in their block. Both see them. Race for them.

Sarah gets there first. Swipes. Catches Liam's forearm.

He retreats—backs through the doorway into—

LIVING ROOM - Liam grabs a floor lamp. Swings it like a bat.
Sarah ducks, but the knife is wrong for this distance.

She circles. He keeps the lamp between them. Standoff.

She feints left, goes right. Slashes the lampshade. He swings
blind—misses—overextends.

She's inside his reach now. The knife comes up—

He catches her wrist. They struggle. Crash into the wall.
Through the drywall. Onto—

THE STAIRS - They tumble. The knife clatters away. Now it's
just hands and desperation.
```

## DESTRUCTIBLE ENVIRONMENTS

Using the environment as both weapon and casualty adds visceral impact.

### Types of Destruction

**1. Improvised Weapons**
- Objects grabbed in desperation (lamp, bottle, chair)
- Should match character (skilled fighter uses what's efficient; desperate person grabs anything)
- Weapons can break, requiring adaptation

**2. Collision Damage**
- Bodies thrown into furniture, walls, windows
- Establishes force and stakes
- Creates debris that affects later fighting

**3. Structural Damage**
- Walls, railings, doors damaged or destroyed
- Can create new routes or block escape
- Major structural damage as climactic beats

### Writing Destruction Effectively

**Make it matter to the fight:**
```
BAD:
They fight. A lamp breaks.

GOOD:
Sarah slams Liam into the bookshelf. It topples—books
avalanche between them. She can't see him. Where—

His hand shoots through the pile. Grabs her ankle. PULLS.
```

**Show consequences:**
```
Glass crunches under their feet now—neither can move quietly.
Every step announces position.
```

**Use destruction for character:**
- A methodical killer causes controlled destruction
- A desperate victim causes chaotic destruction
- Someone losing control escalates the destruction

### The "Home Alone" Principle

For trap-based fights (like in Hunted), destruction should be:
1. **Set up earlier** (we see the trap prepared)
2. **Triggered with tension** (will it work?)
3. **Partially effective** (rarely a clean win)
4. **Have consequences** (fire spreads, structure weakens)

## TIMING ESTIMATION

### The Basic Rule
**One screenplay page = approximately one minute of screen time**

But fight scenes break this rule.

### The Problem

- "They fight" = 1 line = could be 3 minutes of screen time
- Detailed choreography = 3 pages = could be 1 minute of screen time

### Estimation Methods

**Method 1: Beat Counting**
Count the major beats (not individual moves) and estimate 10-15 seconds per beat:

```
Beat 1: Initial clash, testing each other (15 sec)
Beat 2: First person gains advantage (10 sec)
Beat 3: Reversal—other person fights back (15 sec)
Beat 4: Crash through environment (10 sec)
Beat 5: Weapon introduced (15 sec)
Beat 6: Climactic exchange (20 sec)
Beat 7: Decisive outcome (10 sec)

TOTAL: ~95 seconds = 1.5 minutes
```

**Method 2: Read-Aloud Timing**
- Read the scene aloud at the pace you imagine it playing
- Add time for non-written action (impacts, pauses, recovery)
- Generally multiply your read time by 1.5-2x

**Method 3: Reference Comparison**
Time similar scenes in reference films, then compare complexity:

| Reference | Duration | Complexity |
|-----------|----------|------------|
| Basic hallway fight | 30-60 sec | 2-3 beats, one location |
| Extended kitchen fight | 1-2 min | 5-7 beats, weapons, destruction |
| Multi-room running battle | 3-5 min | 10+ beats, multiple locations |
| Climactic final battle | 5-10 min | Full arc with multiple phases |

### Timing Factors

**Faster than expected:**
- Quick cuts/editing
- One-sided beatdown
- Professional, efficient fighters

**Slower than expected:**
- Long takes/minimal cuts
- Both fighters injured/exhausted
- Pauses for dialogue or reaction
- Slow-motion moments
- Environment interaction

### For Hunted Specifically

The Hank vs. Liam fight (Scenes 7-8) estimation:

```
Scene 7 - The Flat Tire (~2-3 minutes)
- Outdoor approach and first arrows: 30 sec
- Porch confrontation and nail trap: 45 sec
- Headbutt and kick-off: 30 sec
- Escape inside: 30 sec
- Objects through windows: 30 sec

Scene 8 - The Battle Inside (~4-5 minutes)
- Initial indoor clash: 45 sec
- Furniture destruction phase: 60 sec
- Sai disarm sequence: 45 sec
- Hank gaining upper hand: 60 sec
- Liam's dirty trick reversal: 45 sec
- Table leg stabbing: 30 sec
- Final execution: 30 sec

COMBINED: 6-8 minutes of screen time
```

## BEST PRACTICES

### Do:
- Serve the story first—every fight should have narrative purpose
- Give each combatant a distinct fighting style that reflects character
- Accumulate damage—injuries persist and affect performance
- Use environment creatively—settings interact with the fight
- Vary the rhythm—mix intense exchanges with tense pauses
- End decisively—avoid draws unless narratively purposeful

### Don't:
- Over-choreograph on the page—leave room for professionals
- Reset between beats—damage and exhaustion accumulate
- Forget geography—reader should always know where everyone is
- Make fights interchangeable—each should feel unique
- Ignore the aftermath—fights have consequences

### Character-Specific Fighting

| Character Type | Fighting Style |
|----------------|----------------|
| Trained professional | Efficient, controlled, minimal wasted movement |
| Street fighter | Dirty, improvised, no rules |
| Desperate civilian | Wild, reactive, grabs anything |
| Methodical killer | Patient, waits for openings, conserves energy |
| Rage-driven avenger | Aggressive, reckless, burns out fast |
