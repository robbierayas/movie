## SCENE WRITING FUNDAMENTALS

### Every Scene Needs Three-Act Structure

**Micro Structure Within Macro Structure:**
- **Setup**: Establish where we are, who's present, what they want
- **Complication**: Conflict arises, things don't go as planned
- **Resolution**: The scene reaches a turning point (doesn't mean "solved"—often means "worse")

**Source**: No Film School, ScreenCraft (2024-2025)

### The Conflict Requirement

> "Every scene, whether long or short, is fundamentally about conflict—every scene has to have conflict to survive."

Conflict doesn't mean fighting. It means:
- Character wants something
- Something prevents them from getting it
- Stakes exist (even small ones)

**Without conflict, you have exposition, not a scene.**

### Scene Goals Checklist

Before writing any scene, answer:
1. **What does the character want in this scene?** (Immediate goal)
2. **What's preventing them from getting it?** (Obstacle)
3. **How does this scene change the story?** (If nothing changes, cut it)
4. **What's the emotional shift?** (Character enters in one state, leaves in another)

### The "Pop Off the Page" Factor

**8 Elements That Make Scenes Grab Readers:**

1. **Clear Objective** - We know what's at stake
2. **Rising Tension** - Complications escalate
3. **Subtext** - Characters want things they won't say
4. **Specificity** - Concrete details, not vague description
5. **Turning Point** - Something changes by scene's end
6. **Economy** - No wasted lines or actions
7. **Visual Storytelling** - Show, don't tell
8. **Surprise** - Unexpected turn, reveal, or reaction

## COMEDY WRITING CORE PRINCIPLES

### Comedy is Character + Point of View

> "Give your characters a point of view and base any humor coming from them off of that point of view - this is the basis of all great comedy writing."

**The Comedy Formula:**
- Character has specific worldview
- World contradicts that worldview
- Comedy emerges from the collision

**Examples:**
- Overconfident idiot meets reality = comedy
- Anxious person's worst-case scenario comes true (but differently) = comedy
- Competent person surrounded by incompetence = comedy

### Structure Before Jokes

> "Despite having only one verbal joke, an entire scene can be hilarious, which all comes down to the structure, with remarkable comedy coming out of interesting situations and genuine character moments."

**This means:**
- Don't write joke-joke-joke
- Write *situation* that generates organic humor
- Let character behavior be funny, not just dialogue

**Example Structure:**
1. Establish normal (or "normal" for this world)
2. Introduce absurd element
3. Characters react according to their POV
4. Situation escalates logically but absurdly
5. Payoff that's surprising but inevitable

### Beats in Comedy

> "In comedy, everything should be building toward the punch lines—or, at the very least, the comedic payoff of whatever situation the characters are in, with the 'setups' being the beats."

**Beat Count by Genre:**
- Low-key character comedy (*Napoleon Dynamite*): 10-15 big beats
- High-energy action comedy (*Die Hard*): 20+ beats
- TV multi-thread structure: 4-5 beats per storyline

**For Anno Bombini (road trip structure):**
- Each settlement = 3-5 beats (arrival, complication, disaster, escape)
- Main story = 12-15 major beats across three acts
- Running gags = 6-8 callbacks throughout

**Source**: Script Magazine, BlueCat Screenplay (2024)

### Comedic Timing Fundamentals

> "Effective comedic timing involves precisely delivering jokes, punchlines, and humorous beats for optimal comedic effect, requiring a deep understanding of rhythm, pacing, and the ability to build anticipation and surprise."

**Timing Elements:**
- **The Pause** - Before a punchline (builds anticipation)
- **The Beat** - After a reaction (lets it land)
- **The Rhythm** - Alternating fast/slow pacing
- **The Surprise** - Subverting expected timing

**How to Write Timing into a Script:**
```
ALEX
We need to leave. Now.

CHEN
Why?

Beat.

The ceiling starts collapsing.

ALEX
That.
```

## DARK COMEDY: BALANCING TONE

### The Core Challenge

> "Writing dark comedy requires a delicate balance between humor and darkness, and finding the right tone is crucial; dark comedy should never feel forced or unnatural."

**The Balance:**
- Too dark = depressing, not funny
- Too light = undermines serious themes
- Just right = absurdity based in reality

### Avoiding Tonal Whiplash

> "Tonal whiplash happens when the storyteller separates the light and dark elements too much. You should not have comedy scenes and dark scenes; every scene should be a dark comedy scene."

**This is critical for Anno Bombini.**

**Wrong approach:**
- Funny scene with heroes goofing around
- Suddenly serious scene about apocalypse horror
- Back to funny scene

**Right approach:**
- Every scene has both darkness and humor
- The humor emerges *from* the darkness
- Consistent tone throughout

**Example from *Pulp Fiction*:**
- Cleaning up a dead body (dark)
- Arguing about coffee and hospitality (funny)
- Combined into one scene = dark comedy

### Starting with Truth

> "A great dark comedy approaches its subject matter with truthfulness, and the best comedy offers absurdity based in reality."

**For Anno Bombini:**
- Real concern: Post-apocalyptic survival is hard
- Absurd twist: People make it harder by being idiots
- Dark truth: The idiots survive while careful planners die
- Comedy emerges: Stupidity as evolutionary advantage

### Creating Complex Characters

> "Writers can start by creating complex characters with flaws that are both comedic and tragic."

**Guy 1 Example:**
- Tragic: Overconfidence will get him killed someday
- Comedic: Today is not that day, despite best efforts
- Complex: Occasionally right by accident, which reinforces delusion

**The Girl Example:**
- Tragic: Stuck with idiots, can't abandon them (loyalty/responsibility)
- Comedic: Her competence makes their incompetence funnier
- Complex: Also makes bad decisions, usually by underestimating how bad it can get

### The Role of Satire

> "Dark comedy is about confronting harsh realities and putting an irreverent or satirical spin on them. Satire is a key element of many dark comedies, allowing filmmakers to use humor to comment on politics, society, and human behavior."

**What Anno Bombini Satirizes:**
- Post-apocalyptic survivor fantasy (preppers, "self-sufficient" types)
- Blind faith and cargo cult thinking
- Bureaucracy and committees even when pointless
- Hero's journey narratives (they're not heroes, they make everything worse)
- Humanity's ability to learn from mistakes (we don't)

## CHARACTER-DRIVEN COMEDY

### Distinct Voice for Each Character

> "Every character should have a distinct voice through their word choices and speaking patterns, creating uniqueness that makes readers immediately know who's speaking."

**Voice Comes From:**
- Background and education level
- Regional speech patterns
- Personality (optimist vs pessimist)
- Intelligence type (book smart vs street smart vs neither)
- Experiences and trauma

**For Anno Bombini:**

**Guy 1 (Overconfident):**
- Short, declarative sentences
- Uses "we" and "team" language
- Military/sports metaphors despite no experience
- Mispronounces words but with authority
- Never asks questions, only states

**Guy 2 (Anxious):**
- Run-on sentences when panicking
- "What if" and "I think maybe" constructions
- References pop culture and stoner logic
- Asks questions constantly
- Qualifies everything

**The Girl:**
- Efficient, direct sentences
- Sarcastic asides and muttered commentary
- Practical vocabulary (tools, logistics, survival)
- Questions that expose others' stupidity
- Resigned sighs written into dialogue

**Billy Bumbler (Raccoon):**
- Repeats last word for emphasis: "Idiots... idiots."
- Only speaks clearly once for maximum impact
- Physical reactions and chittering do the work

### Humor from Character POV

> "When humor arises naturally from who a character is and how they react to the world, it feels authentic and unexpected."

**Character Reaction = Comedy Gold**

Same situation, three different reactions:

**Scenario:** They find a working vending machine in the wasteland.

**Guy 1 Reaction:**
"Score! This is a sign. We're on the right path."
[Tries to use bottlecaps as currency]

**Guy 2 Reaction:**
"Is it... safe? What if it's a trap? Why would a vending machine still work? Unless... it's bait. This is definitely bait."
[Stands back while Guy 1 operates it]

**Girl Reaction:**
"It's not plugged in."
[Walks away]

**Raccoon Reaction:**
[Climbs behind machine, emerges with bag of chips]

### Natural Delivery

> "Natural delivery means dialogue flows like real speech but is actually tighter, funnier, and more purposeful."

**Techniques:**
- **Interruptions** - People talk over each other
- **Incomplete thoughts** - Sentences trail off
- **Contradictions** - Character says one thing, does another
- **Subtext** - What they mean ≠ what they say

## VISUAL & PHYSICAL COMEDY

### Why Visual Comedy Matters

> "Visual comedy is not just about words but also visual gags and physical humor, and it's important for adding an extra layer of humor that enhances the comedic impact."

**Benefits:**
- Universal appeal (transcends language barriers)
- Engages sight as well as sound
- Creates memorable comedic moments
- Breaks up dialogue-heavy scenes

### Writing Physical Comedy in Screenplays

> "Writers should write detailed stage directions that clearly outline the physical actions of their characters."

**How to Write Visual Gags:**

**Vague (Bad):**
```
Alex tries to open the door but fails.
```

**Specific (Good):**
```
Alex grabs the door handle. Pulls. Nothing.
Pulls harder. Still nothing. Braces foot against
the wall, yanks with full body weight--

The handle breaks off. Alex stumbles backward,
trips over Chen's outstretched leg, crashes into
the wall.

The door swings open by itself. It was a push door.
```

### The Three Pillars of Physical Comedy

1. **Exaggerated Actions** - Over-the-top movements (Jim Carrey elastic face, arms flailing)
2. **Pratfalls** - Deliberate trips, falls, collisions (must be safe but look painful)
3. **Visual Gags** - Jokes told through props, settings, background action

**For Anno Bombini:**

**Exaggerated Actions:**
- Guy 1's overconfident swagger
- Guy 2's twitchy anxiety movements
- Raccoon's knowing head tilts and eye rolls

**Pratfalls:**
- Escaping the bunker: slapstick sprint with collisions, trips, narrow misses
- Vehicle acquisition: bumbling theft with physical comedy

**Visual Gags:**
- Cargo cult's elaborate Roomba altar
- Prepper's useless zombie defenses
- Nuke cult members glowing slightly, nobody acknowledging it

### Environment as Comedy Tool

> "Scenes should communicate humor through props, settings, or background antics, making thoughtful use of environments and objects to enhance the joke."

**Examples:**
- **Prepper compound:** Every defense is for the wrong threat (zombie spikes, gas masks, antivirus software CDs)
- **Hermit's fortress:** Massive walls defending empty desert; elaborate traps positioned where nothing lives
- **Cargo cult temple:** Extension cords leading nowhere, batteries arranged in ritual patterns
- **Nuke bunker:** Religious iconography painted *over* radiation warnings

### Timing Physical Comedy

> "This genre requires meticulous timing, exquisite control over one's body, and an intimate understanding of the rhythm and flow of a scene."

**Writing Physical Timing:**
- Short sentences = fast action
- Paragraph breaks = pause for reaction
- "Beat" = moment for physics to catch up (pause before fall)

**Example:**
```
Guy 1 steps forward confidently.

The floor creaks.

He freezes.

Beat.

The floor collapses.
```

## SETUP, PAYOFF, CALLBACKS & RUNNING GAGS

### Understanding the Difference

**Callback:**
> "A callback references something established earlier and recontextualizes it for a new laugh."

**Running Gag:**
> "A running gag establishes a pattern, then subverts it repeatedly."

**Setup/Payoff:**
> "A joke is both a setup and a payoff. Industry leaders call out 'plant and payoff' as the DNA of iconic comedy scenes."

### The Psychology of Callbacks

> "Callback jokes activate the part of the brain that loves recognizing patterns and connecting dots, and when a callback lands, the audience feels smart and rewarded."

**Why They Work:**
- Audience recognizes the reference
- Feels clever for catching it
- Surprised by new context
- Laugh is bigger than original joke

### Timing and Distance

> "A callback is most effective when audiences have forgotten the original reference - when they encounter it again unexpectedly, the surprise creates a bigger laugh."

**Golden Rule:**
> "Small setups that audiences can forget before encountering a huge punch much later tend to be most satisfying."

**Traditional Structure:**
- Setups: Act One and first half of Act Two
- Payoffs: After the midpoint through Act Three

**For 90-Minute Comedy:**
- Setup in first 20 minutes
- Callback at 50+ minutes
- Final payoff at 75+ minutes

### Running Gags Must Evolve

> "Recurring gags must grow, not just repeat."

**Wrong Approach:**
- Character says catchphrase
- Character says catchphrase again
- Character says catchphrase again
- (Audience is bored)

**Right Approach:**
- Character says phrase in normal context
- Character says phrase in absurd context (escalation)
- Character *tries* to say phrase but is interrupted
- Different character says phrase mockingly
- Original character says phrase at pivotal moment (payoff)

### Application to Anno Bombini

**Setup/Payoff Examples:**

**The Raccoon's Intelligence:**
- **Setup (Act 1):** Raccoon repeats last word: "Home... home..."
- **Mid-point (Act 2):** Raccoon leads them out of danger, clearly smarter
- **Payoff (Act 3):** Raccoon speaks clearly for first time: "Idiots."

**Guy 1's Overconfidence:**
- **Setup:** "Trust me, I know exactly what I'm doing."
- **Pattern:** Every time he says this, disaster follows
- **Escalation:** Each disaster gets worse
- **Payoff:** Says it before triggering the nuke, proving he learned nothing

**The Girl's Warnings:**
- **Setup:** "This is a bad idea." [Ignored]
- **Pattern:** She's right every time, ignored every time
- **Escalation:** Her warnings get more specific and dire
- **Payoff:** "This is the WORST idea." [Still ignored, biggest disaster]

**Running Gag Examples:**

**"It's Not Portable":**
- Each settlement offers something valuable but impractical
- Guy 1 always asks "Can we bring it back?"
- Answer is always some version of "no"
- Final version: "Can we bring—" DETONATION SEQUENCE INITIATED

**Guy 2's Doomsday Scenarios:**
- Predicts worst-case outcome at every location
- Reality is always different but equally bad
- He's never right about the *type* of disaster, always right that there *will be* one
- Final version: Predicts explosion. Actually correct this time.

**Things That Follow Them:**
- Preppers' mutant bear escapes, seen in background later
- Hermit's trap goes off after they leave
- Cargo cult members searching for them
- Mounting trail of destruction literally following

### Callbacks as Connective Tissue

> "When a throwaway line or prop circles back in Act Three, your story feels both surprising and inevitable."

**The Checklist:**
- Plant the setup early and naturally
- Don't telegraph it as important
- Let audience forget about it
- Bring it back in new context
- Make the callback earn a bigger laugh than the setup

## COMEDIC DIALOGUE TECHNIQUES

### Pattern and Subversion

> "One of the strongest comedic dialogue techniques is establishing a pattern, then breaking it."

**The Formula:**
1. Character responds to question in specific way
2. Character responds to similar question same way
3. Pattern established (audience expects response)
4. Character responds *completely differently* to similar question
5. Laugh from subverted expectation

**Example:**
```
GIRL
Are you sure about this?

GUY 1
Absolutely.

GIRL
Are you absolutely sure?

GUY 1
One hundred percent.

GIRL
You're completely certain?

GUY 1
(Beat)
No. Not even a little.
```

### Compression and One-Liners

> "A lot of funny dialogue comes from one-liners, humorous responses to situations that are short and punchy."

**Economy of Language:**
- Fewer words = bigger impact
- Cut qualifiers ("kind of", "sort of", "maybe")
- Get to the punchline fast

**Wrong:**
```
ALEX
Well, I mean, this is sort of a bad situation,
and I think we might be in some trouble here,
which is probably not great.
```

**Right:**
```
ALEX
We're screwed.
```

**OR, if character voice requires rambling:**
```
ALEX
Well, I mean, this is sort of a bad situation,
and I think we might be in some trouble here,
which is probably--

The building explodes.

ALEX
Yeah. That.
```

### Banter Tips

**Keep It Snappy:**
- Short exchanges build momentum
- Rapid-fire back-and-forth
- Characters bounce off each other
- Cut anything that slows the rhythm

**Example:**
```
GUY 1
Plan B.

GUY 2
What was Plan A?

GUY 1
That was Plan A.

GUY 2
So we don't have a Plan B?

GUY 1
Plan B is we make it up as we go.

GUY 2
That's not a plan!

GUY 1
It's worked so far.

GIRL
We almost died three times today.

GUY 1
*Almost.*
```

### Avoid Over-Explaining

> "Trust the reader to get the joke, and let characters bounce off each other."

**Show Don't Tell:**
- Don't have character explain why something is funny
- Don't over-describe in action lines
- Trust the joke to land

**Wrong:**
```
ALEX
That's like trying to teach a fish to climb
a tree! Which is funny because fish can't
climb trees, obviously, so I'm saying it's
impossible.
```

**Right:**
```
ALEX
That's like trying to teach a fish to climb a tree.

CHEN
I'd watch that YouTube channel.
```

### Subtext and Misdirection

**What They Say ≠ What They Mean**

```
GUY 1
(Bleeding from head wound)
I'm fine.

GIRL
You're bleeding.

GUY 1
Barely.

GIRL
From your head.

GUY 1
It's not that bad.

Guy 1 collapses.

GUY 2
Should we help him?

GIRL
Give it a minute. He'll be fine.
```

**The Comedy:** Nobody says "This is serious" but everyone knows it is. The understatement IS the joke.

## TIMING, PACING & RHYTHM

### The Rhythm of Comedy

> "The rhythm and cadence of a comedy screenplay are key to maintaining audience engagement, as seen in 'The Office', where the rhythm alternates between fast-paced back-and-forths and slower, awkward silences, keeping viewers on their toes."

**Rhythm = Variation**
- Fast dialogue → slow reaction
- Action sequence → quiet beat
- Chaos → sudden silence
- Build tension → release with joke

### Establishing Comedic Beats

> "Establishing comedic beats creates rhythm, allowing moments for your audience to laugh."

**This means: Leave space.**

**Wrong Approach:**
- Joke-joke-joke-joke (no time to laugh)
- Audience misses jokes because still laughing from previous

**Right Approach:**
- Joke → beat/reaction → next joke
- Rhythm: setup → punchline → pause → setup → punchline → pause

**In Screenplay Format:**
```
GUY 1
Trust me. I've done this before.

Beat. Guy 2 and Girl exchange looks.

GUY 2
When have you done this before?

GUY 1
I haven't. But how hard can it be?

The machine starts beeping.

GIRL
Very hard, apparently.
```

### Fast vs. Slow Pacing

**When to Go Fast:**
- Escalating chaos
- Mounting disasters
- Slapstick physical comedy
- Rapid-fire banter
- Escape sequences

**When to Go Slow:**
- Awkward silences (comedy from discomfort)
- Character processing absurdity
- Building to big punchline
- After major disaster (shock/disbelief)

**Example from Anno Bombini:**

**Fast pacing:**
```
They race down the tunnel. Guy 1 trips. Guy 2
jumps over him. Girl pulls Guy 1 up. They run
harder. Raccoon leads the way. Cultists step
into their path. They dodge. Slip. Stumble. Keep
running. Countdown continues: "30 seconds."
```

**Slow pacing:**
```
They emerge from the tunnel.

Dive behind rocks.

Silence.

Girl looks at the two guys.

GIRL
(Quietly)
Did we just--

BOOM.
```

### The "Beat" in Screenwriting

**Definition:** A pause in dialogue or action, usually indicating:
- Character thinking/processing
- Comedic timing pause
- Reaction moment
- Awkward silence

**Usage:**
```
ALEX
We could just leave.

Beat.

CHEN
Yeah. We could.

Beat.

Neither of them moves.
```

**When NOT to use:**
- Every line (overuse kills impact)
- To pad page count
- When action is continuous

## PRACTICAL APPLICATION TO ANNO BOMBINI

### Scene-by-Scene Comedy Strategy

Using the principles above, here's how to approach each major sequence:

### ACT ONE: THE SETTLEMENT

**Tone:** Deadpan absurdity
**Pacing:** Moderate, establishing rhythm
**Comedy Type:** Character-driven, satirical

**Setup Examples:**

**SCENE: Town Meeting**
- **Structure:** They present GPS device → leader makes worst decision → they're stuck going
- **Comedy:** Bureaucratic absurdity (voting, committees, Robert's Rules of Order for apocalypse)
- **Visual:** Official "town hall" is repurposed Walmart, people dressed in formal wasteland attire
- **Dialogue:** Pattern of officials mishearing/misunderstanding technology
- **Payoff Setup:** Plant that "finders are envoys" (callback when they later regret finding anything)

**Character Introductions:**
- Guy 1: Volunteers confidently, doesn't understand the danger
- Guy 2: Tries to un-volunteer, fails
- Girl: Resigns herself to keeping them alive
- Establish their dynamic before the journey

### ACT TWO: THE JOURNEY

**Tone:** Escalating chaos with consistent dark comedy
**Pacing:** Fast (between settlements) → slow (arrival) → fast (disaster)
**Comedy Type:** Physical, visual, situational

**SEQUENCE 1: The Preppers**

**Scene Structure:**
1. **Arrival** (Slow) - Fortified compound, preppers explain defensive systems
2. **Complication** (Medium) - Heroes realize it's all wrong (zombie prep for animal apocalypse)
3. **Disaster** (Fast) - They accidentally release the contained mutant
4. **Escape** (Very Fast) - Slapstick exit as preppers deploy useless countermeasures

**Comedy Layers:**
- **Visual:** Zombie-proof walls with "Dead Inside" graffiti, gas masks, antivirus software CDs
- **Dialogue:** Preppers proudly explain systems that make no sense
- **Physical:** The mutant's escape is Rube Goldberg chain reaction
- **Character:** Guy 1 "helps" by making it worse, Guy 2 predicts wrong disaster, Girl tries to stop them (fails)
- **Callback Setup:** Mutant bear follows them for rest of film (background gag)

**SEQUENCE 2: The Hermit**

**Scene Structure:**
1. **Arrival** - Discover elaborate fortress in middle of nowhere
2. **Monologue** - Hermit's insane paranoid speech (darkly comedic)
3. **Information** - Hermit reveals cult rumors (plot advancement)
4. **Raccoon** - Find injured raccoon, "rescue" it poorly

**Comedy Layers:**
- **Visual:** Massive defenses protecting nothing, traps everywhere
- **Dialogue:** Hermit's conspiracy theories are partially right but mostly insane
- **Character:** Each hero interprets hermit differently (Guy 1: respect, Guy 2: fear, Girl: pity)
- **Physical:** Their attempts to help raccoon make it worse
- **Running Gag:** Raccoon immediately demonstrates more intelligence than them

**SEQUENCE 3: Cargo Cult**

**Scene Structure:**
1. **Arrival** - Witness religious ceremony around Roomba
2. **Cultural Exchange** - Heroes try to explain it's broken, treated as heretics
3. **Destruction** - Guy 1 "fixes" it by destroying it
4. **Chase** - Angry mob, slapstick escape

**Comedy Layers:**
- **Visual:** Elaborate altar of extension cords, batteries in ritual patterns, priests in Best Buy shirts
- **Satire:** Organized religion around consumer technology
- **Dialogue:** Priests' solemn interpretation of error beeps
- **Physical:** Guy 1's "repair" involves hitting it with rock
- **Callback:** Roomba piece falls out of bag later, they've accidentally stolen sacred relic

**SEQUENCE 4: Rival Idiots**

**Scene Structure:**
1. **Meeting** - Tense standoff, both groups suspicious
2. **Team-Up** - Forced cooperation for one obstacle
3. **Betrayal** - Both attempt to betray each other, both fail
4. **Vehicle Theft** - Heroes "win" by stealing vehicle

**Comedy Layers:**
- **Character Mirror:** Rivals reflect heroes' flaws back at them
- **Dialogue:** Banter between groups trying to out-smart each other (all failing)
- **Physical:** The obstacle they team up for (creature or environmental hazard)
- **Irony:** Neither group is competent enough to successfully betray the other
- **Setup:** Vehicle acquisition for later sequences

**SEQUENCE 5: Big Creature Set-Piece**

**Scene Structure:**
1. **Warning** - Raccoon tries to alert them to danger
2. **Ignorance** - They ignore warning, proceed
3. **Encounter** - Major creature attack (practical + VFX showcase)
4. **Escape** - Narrow survival through Girl's competence and dumb luck

**Comedy Layers:**
- **Physical:** Action-comedy choreography (heroes are clumsy, ineffective)
- **Visual:** Creature design is bizarre, not traditionally threatening
- **Character:** Guy 1 tries leadership moves (fail), Guy 2 panics correctly, Girl actually fights
- **Callback:** Raccoon saves them, proving again it's the smartest one
- **Running Gag:** Guy 1 claims victory despite nearly dying

### ACT THREE: THE NUKE CULT

**Tone:** Darkest comedy, absurdity meets consequences
**Pacing:** Slow build → medium tension → FAST panic → slow aftermath
**Comedy Type:** Dark satire, physical, payoffs

**SCENE: The Temple**

**Structure:**
1. **Discovery** - Descend into bunker, witness temple
2. **Realization** - Heroes recognize it's a nuke
3. **Debate** - Cult insists it's divine, won't be dissuaded
4. **Negotiation** - Heroes ask for piece, cult warns them
5. **Attempt** - They try to chip off piece
6. **Trigger** - Detonation sequence starts
7. **Escape** - Slapstick panic sprint
8. **Explosion** - They watch from distance

**Comedy Layers:**

**Visual:**
- Religious iconography painted over radiation warnings
- Cultists glowing slightly from radiation
- "Eternal flame" is literally a nuclear warhead with "WARHEAD" stenciled on side
- Elaborate rituals around obviously dangerous military weapon

**Dialogue:**
```
GUY 1
Is that a nuclear bomb?

HIGH PRIEST
The Eternal Flame.

GUY 1
It says "warhead" on the side.

HIGH PRIEST
The god's holy name.

GUY 2
It's... ticking.

HIGH PRIEST
Divine messages.

GIRL
You're all glowing.

HIGH PRIEST
The blessing of communion.

GIRL
That's radiation poisoning.

HIGH PRIEST
Potato, po-tah-to.
```

**Physical:**
- Guy 1 casually touching bomb with tools
- Cultists working around it like it's normal
- Raccoon refusing to enter (smartest choice)
- The sprint: trips, collisions, cultists in the way

**Dark Comedy Balance:**
- Cultists are clearly dying (dark)
- They've been warned repeatedly (their choice)
- They're annoyingly committed to delusion (unsympathetic)
- Heroes tried to help/warn (not villains)
- Explosion is from distance (no graphic death)
- Nobody innocent dies (all chose to stay)

**Payoffs:**

- **Guy 1's Confidence:** "I know what I'm doing" → triggers nuke
- **Guy 2's Anxiety:** Finally right about disaster type
- **Girl's Warnings:** Most dire warning yet, still ignored, worst result yet
- **Raccoon's Intelligence:** Speaks clearly for only time: "Idiots"
- **Trail of Destruction:** This is the culmination, biggest disaster
- **Unlimited Power Source:** Technically true, very literally true

**SCENE: The Aftermath**

**Structure:**
1. **Silence** - Processing what happened
2. **The Word** - Raccoon judges them
3. **Rationalization** - They begin spinning the story
4. **Return** - Journey home montage

**Comedy:**
- Contrast between mushroom cloud and casual conversation
- Guy 1 already reframing as success
- Guy 2 in shock but going along
- Girl's resigned exhaustion
- Raccoon's disgusted but stuck with them

### The Return/Ending

**Three Options:**

**Option A: The Liars**
- Tell settlement they succeeded
- Celebrated as heroes
- Radio chatter about explosion (ominous)
- They've learned nothing, story accepted

**Comedy:** Satire of how easily people believe lies they want to believe

**Option B: Honest Idiots**
- Explain exactly what happened
- Settlement accepts insane logic
- "They were going to die anyway"
- Somehow this makes sense to everyone

**Comedy:** Nobody learns anything, circular logic accepted

**Option C: Sequel Hook**
- Return to find new signal
- Leader: "Good news! Another signal came in..."
- Heroes groan
- Raccoon: "Idiots... idiots..."
- Hard cut to black

**Comedy:** The cycle continues, they'll do it again

### Key Principles Applied Throughout:

1. **Every scene has conflict** - Even small settlements, there's a problem
2. **Consistent dark comedy tone** - Humor AND darkness in every scene
3. **Character-driven** - Comedy comes from their POV, not just situations
4. **Visual comedy** - Each location has sight gags
5. **Setup/payoff structure** - Running gags pay off in Act 3
6. **Escalation** - Each disaster worse than the last
7. **Rhythm variation** - Fast chase → slow aftermath
8. **No lessons learned** - Characters end as they began

## MONTAGES IN COMEDY

Montages are especially useful in comedy for showing repetitive failures, escalating chaos, or thematic absurdity.

### Comedy Montage Types

**Failure Escalation:**
Shows character(s) repeatedly failing with each attempt getting worse.
```
MONTAGE - TRYING TO START THE VEHICLE

- Guy 1 turns key. Nothing.
- Guy 2 checks under hood. Engine falls out.
- Girl tries hotwiring. Sparks. Small fire.
- All three push vehicle. Wheel falls off.
- Raccoon points to "Out of Gas" light. They stare.

END MONTAGE
```

**Making Everything Worse:**
Each location they visit becomes a disaster.
```
MONTAGE - THE TRAIL OF DESTRUCTION

SETTLEMENT 1: They "help" repair wall. It collapses.
SETTLEMENT 2: They offer advice. Causes argument.
SETTLEMENT 3: They trade supplies. Accidentally start fire.
SETTLEMENT 4: They try to leave quietly. Alarms trigger.

END MONTAGE
```

**Contrasting Reactions:**
Different characters/groups react to same event in comedically different ways.
```
MONTAGE - REACTIONS TO THE EXPLOSION

HOME SETTLEMENT: Panicked emergency meeting, arguing.
PREPPERS: Smug "told you so" attitudes, updating doomsday charts.
HERMIT: Adding mushroom cloud photo to conspiracy wall.
CARGO CULT: Interpreting as divine sign, new rituals.
RIVAL IDIOTS: Trying to claim credit for explosion.

END MONTAGE
```

**Training Montage (Comedy Version):**
Subvert the classic training montage with failure.
```
MONTAGE - LEARNING TO FIGHT (BADLY)

- Week 1: Guy 1 attempts punch. Misses. Spins around. Falls.
- Week 2: Guy 2 tries kick. Loses balance. Crashes into Guy 1.
- Week 3: Girl demonstrates proper form. Guys nod. Immediately forget.
- Week 4: All three spar. Tangle themselves. Collapse in heap.
- Week 5: Actual fight. They run away. It works.

END MONTAGE
```

### Comedy Montage Tips

**1. Use Rule of Three (or Five)**
Comedy benefits from pattern establishment + subversion:
- First attempt: Fails
- Second attempt: Fails differently
- Third attempt: Fails spectacularly OR succeeds accidentally

**2. Each Shot is a Mini Punchline**
Every line should have a comedic payoff:
```
❌ Weak:
- Guy 1 tries to fix radio.
- Guy 2 looks at map.
- Girl organizes supplies.

✅ Strong:
- Guy 1 "fixes" radio. It catches fire.
- Guy 2 reads map upside down, very confident.
- Girl organizes supplies. Finds live grenade. Slowly sets it down.
```

**3. Build to Biggest Laugh**
Order shots from smaller laughs to biggest:
```
MONTAGE - RACCOON PROVING HE'S SMARTER

- Raccoon finds water. Humans walk past it.
- Raccoon catches fish. Humans try, fall in river.
- Raccoon builds shelter. Humans sleep in rain.
- Raccoon signals danger. Humans ignore him, trigger trap.
- Raccoon speaks: "Idiots." Humans: "Did he just—?"

END MONTAGE
```

**4. Callbacks Within Montage**
Create mini-callbacks across the montage shots:
```
MONTAGE - GUY 1'S OVERCONFIDENCE

- "Trust me, I know what I'm doing." Opens wrong door. Closet.
- "Trust me, I know what I'm doing." Pushes when should pull.
- "Trust me, I know what I'm doing." Girl: "Please stop saying that."
- "Trust me—" Guy 2: "Don't." Guy 1 does it anyway. Disaster.

END MONTAGE
```

**5. Use for Dark Comedy Payoffs**
Montages can set up later dark comedy reveals:
```
MONTAGE - SETTLEMENTS THEY VISITED

SETTLEMENT 1: Wave goodbye to heroes.
SETTLEMENT 2: Thank them for help.
SETTLEMENT 3: Wish them luck on journey.
SETTLEMENT 4: Heroes wave back, walk away.

END MONTAGE

Later in Act 3:
Radio chatter mentions all four settlements have been destroyed
(by problems the heroes caused).
```

### When NOT to Montage Comedy

**Don't montage:**
- Dialogue-heavy jokes (needs real scenes)
- Physical comedy requiring detailed choreography
- Character relationship development
- Key plot information
- The funniest set piece of the movie

**Montages work for:**
- Time compression (journey, passage of days)
- Repetitive failures
- Escalating pattern
- Thematic connections
- Quick establishment of status quo
